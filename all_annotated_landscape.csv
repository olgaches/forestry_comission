1925-03-30a.992.4.txt;;['I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."The origin of this Bill is rather quaint. The year before last, when I had the honour of being Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, it was brought home to me very forcibly that these new roads which had been constructed, and were being constructed in the vicinity of the Metropolis, however excellent they might be from the transportation point of view and however useful from the national aspect are extremely ugly. I think the House will agree with me that a great wide stretch of road surface, in most parts bounded by concrete posts bound together by iron wires, is not a very graceful or grateful addition to the landscape. So I went into the matter rather fully, and came to the conclusion that, if proper trees be planted alongside some of these great roads, it would, at any rate, in a few years take off the bareness of the aspect and replace many trees which had had to be cut down when these new roads were made.In my preparation I included an estimate of GBP 10,000 or GBP 12,000 for capital expenditure: on planting trees. I consulted Kew, I consulted the Forestry Commission, and, indeed, had mapped out what sections of the roads and what particular trees should be planted. All went well until a vigilant officer in my Department discovered that I had no power to do anything of that sort, nor to apply any of the Road Fund to what I considered this very excellent purpose. The Minister could construct the road, drain the road, maintain the road from the Road Fund, but the one thing he could not do was to beautify the road in any way at all. I then promised to bring in a Bill to do away with what I considered the defects of the law, and while I was doing so it occurred to me that other things might be added. We were spending, and are spending, GBP 42,000,000 every year in keeping up our roads, and I think the result is that we have better roads than any other country in the world; but neither the Ministry of Transport nor the local authority has power to spend money in experiments in order to see which form of road is the best, and what road surfaces ought to be used. I think it a very absurd and very uneconomic position to be in, to spend these huge sums of money every year, and yet not allowed to spend GBP 10,000, GBP 20,000, GBP 30,000, or GBP 40,000 in experiments by which we might probably save GBP 2,000,000 or GBP 3,000,000 a year. Therefore, I attached that provision to the Bill.Owing to circumstances over which we had no control, another Government came into office and my hon. Friend the Member for Whitechapel (Mr. Gosling) became Minister of Transport. May I say we are, I am sure, very glad to see him back again with us after his absence owing to ill-health and I hope he will be able to say a word or two on the Bill this evening. Well, he, I think, agreed departmentally with his political adversary, and endorsed both the tree-planting and the experimental items, and he added one or two items of his own to which I agree, namely, to use money from the Road Fund in order to free the roads from tolls. At present local authorities can use money for freeing roads and bridges from tolls, but no money can be given from the Road Fund for that excellent purpose. There may be exceptional circumstances where tolls may be imposed for a limited number of years, but I submit that tolls should be done away with and that all bridges should be freed from toll. He also added power to use the Road Fund for putting milestones and sign posts and placing direction posts in various places.That, I think, is all the Bill contains. It is a very small Bill, but I maintain quite seriously that in this Bill there may be the germ of considerable economies In the administration of our roads, and if for no other reason than that we are allowed to spend money upon experiments, I do, in my considered judgment-and I hope it is the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Whitechapel-think we may save hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, ever year in the construction of new roads. I, therefore, submit we should give this important Measure a Second Reading. My hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir E. Iliffe) has a Bill which he introduced which is printed and which seeks to do away with blind corners. Blind corners are extremely dangerous things. I need not stress that matter. I think if we can do away with them we ought to. To my mind this is a matter which should be done on a national basis. It should not be done on a basis of allowing local authorities to adopt this and that Clause in any Local Government Bill. If the House thinks some means ought to be taken to do away with blind corners that ought to be done by the country as a whole, and we ought not to allow each local authority to take it or not as they think fit.I am not sure that I agree with everything that is in the Bill of the hon. Member for Tamworth, in that he has made in that Bill no provision whatever for compensation. I think this House ought to hesitate very much before it inflicts very considerable loss on a person without compensation at all. Very often where two second- or third-class roads meet, there is a very good building site fur a public-house or petrol station or fur a shop, and to say, as it is said in my hon. Friend\'s Bill, that practically no house should be put up for a certain distance from the point of intersection of the two roads without any compensation goes further than this House has ever gone before, and further than I personally should like to go. But having said that, I would like the hon. Member to do me the honour of coming to talk with me in order to see if we could agree to some Clause which we might introduce in Committee, and if it then commends itself to a sense of fairness, I shall be glad to consider it favourably. I am sure we are anxious to do away with blind corners if at all possible.There is only one other matter about which I have to say a word. I see that some hon. Friends of mine have put down a reasoned Amendment to this Bill in the following terms: That this House, while approving of the power to conduct research and experiments on road construction and on the freeing of roads from tolls, cannot sanction expenditure on those objects out of the Road Fund until all rural roads upon which there is motor traffic receive a fairer proportion of the said fund. I am not misrepresenting hon. Members who put that down, in saying that I think they do not object to the Bill as a Bill. That being so, I hope that they are not now going to use the speeches they have prepared for another occasion. But be that as it may, I make no complaint. It is quite right to put down this reasoned Amendment if they entertain very strong feelings about the money being allocated for the roads, and I welcome any discussion on that point under the Rules of Order which you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, lay down from the Chair. It is a little hard that I should be the Minister who should have to stand the fire of my hon. Friends. In 1923, when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, in charge of that Department, I was the first person to make a proposition in regard to this matter. Having lived a good deal in the country, and having been a member of one of those local bodies, I know their needs, and I am fully aware of the very pressing burden that is now placed upon the local rates. That is the reason why I proposed grants amounting to GBP 1,500,000 for the repair of rural roads used by such a large number of motorists.I know it is very hard indeed in cases where the poor rural ratepayer has to find the money for the repair of these unclassified roads. As far as classified roads in rural areas are concerned they receive 50 per cent. for first-class roads and 25 per cent. for second-class roads. Therefore the only roads we have now to specially to consider are the unclassified roads. What the House ought to bear in mind is that the Road Fund is a national fund instituted for the purpose of maintaining and improving the main communications of this country. Above all, I hope my hon. Friends will bear in mind that the Fund was not instituted to relieve local rates, but in order to improve and maintain our main communications. Having said that, I am perfectly willing, if I find that I am able to do so, to help these rural roads in order to have them put in as good a state of repair as possible.I would like to point out to those who are putting forward the Amendment to which I have referred that, roughly, for the last three years the total revenue of the Road Fund was GBP 42,000,000, and before 1923 not one single penny was given to unclassified rural roads, but during the three years I have mentioned, the sum of GBP 5,000,000, if what I hope to give this time is included, will have been devoted to rural roads, both classified and unclassified. I think if you have an entirely new service, and the income is GBP 42,000,000, and I give GBP 5,000,000 to unclassified rural roads, which do not bear the main stream of traffic in the country, I am not behaving ungenerously to the rural roads.'];;neutral
1951-05-01a.1143.5.txt;;['My good fortune in securing the Adjournment debate tonight is offset by the occasion as, following an important Division, my opening remarks are unlikely to be heard. I make no excuse, however, for taking the attention of the House away from the materialistic question which we have been discussing, to direct it, for a few minutes, to the necessity for the preservation of trees and the planting, where possible, of many more trees. I am encouraged by the mention of the glory of trees in a leading article in the "Evening Standard" which appeared last week, and to a eulogy of the oak which appeared in the "Daily Express" of Saturday last. To my mind, the subject becomes especially significant at this time of the year, when trees are in their first seasonal glory, and when we are but a matter of hours from the opening of the Festival of Britain. For many years I have been concerned at the extent of tree felling in this country. Many districts are gradually being denuded of their trees and of their foliage. I am confirmed in my opinion by a statement made on 4th April in another place by the Lord Chancellor in a speech on the Forestry Bill, when he said: I confess that I am beginning to get quite appalled concerning the extent to which our trees are being cut down. He continued: After all, trees-and in this connection I mean roadside trees and hedgerow trees-largely constitute the beauty of our countryside, and it is lamentable to see the extent to which, owing to the need for timber, and so on, at the present time, they are being sacrificed. I think that the majority, if not all, of hon. Members in the House will agree with the Lord Chancellor, and will share his concern. He made a particular reference to forests and trees in the West Country but tree felling is not merely confined to that part of the country. It is widespread. I am aware that local authorities have powers to make preservation orders, and it may be that in his reply the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what use, generally, has been made of these powers. I am not asking necessarily for a greater use of these powers, but I seek to call attention to the fact that we are losing annually many trees, and I would make the plea that where preservation is not possible new trees may be planted to replace those felled. In some 20 years\' service with local authorities as a city councillor, I have long realised that much felling is due to development, to the dangers caused by such trees as the elm tree, and to other causes. I know, also, of the good work done by many local authorities, not only in preservation, but in tree planting. In Leeds, before the war, I saw a new ring road driven through the Chapeltown Valley. Scores of young trees were planted by the Leeds Corporation on either side of that highway, and today, as you yourself must know, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, the Gledhow Valley Road is one of the most beautiful roads in that city. I also remember, before the war, when slum clearance was at its height in Leeds, the Rev. Charles Jenkinson, then Chairman of the Housing Committee, whose untimely death was mourned by political friend and foe alike, announcing that for each new house built in the City of Leeds, a tree would also toe planted. In more recent years, another enlightened local authority, the Bedfordshire County Council, planted 500 trees on their smallholdings estates to celebrate the birth of Prince Charles. They planted lime, plane, red oak, beech, sycamore, horse chestnut and Norway maple. I think that Festival year is another great opportunity for all local authorities to celebrate by tree planting ceremonies, and I hope that many, if not all, will make full use of the occasion to add to the number of trees in this country. In my own borough, Wembley, another enlightened local authority, if I may say so, it is estimated that there are probably 15,000 trees. Many of them are on the council\'s own open spaces, and will be carefully preserved for amenity purposes. On Saturday last, I looked from the Wembley Stadium at one of the few hills in Middlesex, Barn Hill, which is surmounted by scores of trees outlined against the horizon. This land is about the most expensive in the county of Middlesex, for the council bought 2.5 acres of it in 1937 for GBP 7,710 in order to preserve the trees. The cost worked out at over GBP 77 a tree, but it was a worth-while purchase. About 25 per cent. of Wembley\'s 15,000 trees have been registered for preservation, but there has been no general removal of unregistered trees. Not everyone is favourably disposed towards restriction but most are co-operative when their fears have been allayed and when they learn our council is always prepared to see an owner\'s point of view and to give consent to removal where circumstances make it desirable. In such cases our council impose a condition requiring another tree to be planted to make good the loss. They offer the advice of the borough engineer and surveyor in selecting a suitable tree. Our council officer is always available to any resident requiring advice on any tree-either as to its condition or its effect on property-to assist in maintaining the trees in the borough at a high standard. I would commend this practice of assistance and guidance to other local authorities. Some such authorities have appointed tree-planting officers. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us how many such officers have been appointed in the country. Many authorities and Government Departments are concerned with the preservation of trees. In addition to the Ministry of Local Government and Planning and the Forestry Commission, there are the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Transport, which Ministry, in its circulars, indicates that the securing of sound technical advice will contribute to economy. There are also the Service Departments. There should be maximum co-operation on the subject with all these Departments. The Secretary of State for War told my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane) on 18th April that approximately 60,000 trees were planted by his Department last year to improve the amenities of camps and that a similar number of trees were planted in training areas. But what a small number. Could not more be planted by Service Departments? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Planning will know that some trees in Harrow will have to be cut down because of Service requirements. Will these trees be replaced? Other interested bodies in addition to Government Departments and local authorities are the National Parks, the National Trust, and tree-lover groups in different parts of the country. I was glad that the Earl of Listowel was able to give assurance last month that the Forestry Commission have no intention of felling any trees which are part of the scenic beauty of some area owned by the National Trust. I have raised this subject entirely on the amenity value, but there are some obvious economic considerations for growing as many trees as possible. There are many landscapes in this country in which the beauty rests wholly upon the trees, whether they grow naturally or have been planted by an owner. I am aware that this subject was raised in this House just two years ago by Mr. Skeffington-Lodge. I have read the OFFICIAL REPORT of that debate and no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary has also read it. Perhaps he could indicate what additional progress has been made during the last two years. I think there will be many who, like myself, appreciate trees and are interested in this subject. I never forget that, as a boy, I lived in a district of woodlands and I was grateful to those who planted and preserved the trees. Today, living in Harrow-on-the-Hill, I look on to a mass of glorious foliage in a preserve of trees, and because I appreciate this heritage I am anxious that in future generations the inhabitants of our land will have no cause to be less appreciative of our efforts today.'];;neutral
1954-04-30a.1953.6.txt;;["I beg to move, That this House welcomes the appointment by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture of a committee to investigate the marketing of home-grown timber; and urges them to invite the committee to do everything in its power to submit an early report. Some 18 months ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Sir I. Orr-Ewing) moved a Motion in this House very much on the lines of the one I am moving today. It might be asked what purpose is served in again asking the House to give consideration to a Motion rather on the same lines, especially in view of the announcement made by the Minister of Agriculture just before the Easter Recess that a committee was being set up to investigate the marketing arrangements for homegrown timber. We believe that we are justified in raising the question again because of our feeling of urgency about the importance of the problem and because we want to go further than the proposed committee can go under its terms of reference. We believe that a national policy for the marketing of home-grown timber is required, and clearly national policy must be decided by this House and not by a Departmental committee. Trees can be grown for three purposes. The first is for defence and stockpiling in preparation for emergencies. That aspect of the matter is largely taken care of by the Forestry Commission, and I understand that that was largely the purpose for which the Forestry Commission was set up. The second purpose is the commercial interest of the private owners who grow timber. The growing of timber is a commercial enterprise, but it is also of considerable national interest because the products of our forests must be made available for building and for similar operations. Otherwise, timber must be imported from overseas at an expensive outlay in foreign exchange and hard currency, frequently dollars. Timber growing is therefore a matter of considerable interest to the Exchequer and to the national economy. The third purpose in the growing of trees is to balance the features of the landscape. This is of interest to the town and country planning section of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which has devoted considerable time to deciding where trees should be grown and what types of trees they should be. Trees also balance the national climate. We have debated in this House methods of inducing artificial rainfall and of controlling in other ways our climate artificially, but I think we are all agreed that little can be done in this direction at the present time. On the other hand, trees are generally understood to play an important part in the control of climate. It is, therefore, a matter of national importance that an adequate proportion of the acreage of this country should be covered with trees. All three aspects of tree growing, whether for defence, for commercial and foreign exchange reasons, or for balancing the landscape or climate have a very considerable national interest. The whole community is very much concerned with what is done, so that anyone who plants trees must naturally expect to have the Government and their agents looking upon what he does from the national aspect, as indeed they do. Perhaps it would be suitable at this moment to declare my own private interest. I am the owner of a very small acreage of woodland. I am not sure that it is sufficiently large to justify my declaring it at all, but I do so to put myself on the right side. I may add that I am in process of renting part of that very small acreage to the Forestry Commission and so helping it to find the further acreages it requires to carry out its planting-up policy. This is a national problem, and the Forestry Commission is the principal national instrument for carrying out the policy of the Government with regard to the further planting of forests and trees. I should like to pay my tribute, as so many other hon. Members have done at different times, to the very fine job which the Commission has carried out over the last 30 or more years, often under quite difficult circumstances. That the Forestry Commission is not so much in the news as many other national concerns which spend Government money is, I think, only a compliment to its efficiency and businesslike methods. I hope that it will continue to carry out the Government's aims in this direction as efficiently and as well in the future as it has done in the past. I suggest that there might be an important extension of the Forestry Commission's functions. The Commission is always very helpful, as I have found in my own personal experience with regard to the interest I have just mentioned. It is very pleased to give advice, in an informal way, to owners of woodlands as to how they should plant them. I think that something in the nature of a more formal advisory service on the forestry side-more parallel to the National Agricultural Advisory Service-would be most helpful, particularly to the smaller woodland owners who probably do not at present realise that they can seek help from the Forestry Commission. I am sure that the National Agricultural Advisory Service is one of the most important factors in the whole agricultural scene at the present time. It is the principal method of increasing agricultural efficiency and of allowing farmers to make use of the experience and knowledge of the scientists quickly and freely in order to improve their methods and efficiency. Something of that kind is required at any rate for the smaller woodland owners. We hear much criticism of the poor quality of our home-grown timber. I think that most hon. Members realise that this is, to a large extent, a result of the vicious onslaughts made on our forests in the two world wars. That has tended to leave only the inferior timber, under normal conditions, to be put on the market. That is not the fault of the timber growers. There is, nevertheless, a strong feeling that home timber is of poor quality. If marketing of home timber is to be facilitated, everything should be done to eradicate that prejudice and to improve its quality as quickly as possible. An advisory service of this kind could do a good job there. It could help the smaller woodland owners to improve the quality of their timber. It could perhaps consult the trade to find out the types of timber required and the right way to present them. It could advise not only on how to grow but on what to grow-and advise also on profitable outlets. It might be asked where the finance would be found for such a service. I do not say that the cost should be borne by the Exchequer. It might be met by some kind of levy on imported timber, but I will return to that a little later. A great deal of disquiet has been felt about the fall in the prices of homegrown timber. That point was in the forefront of my hon. Friend's speech when this matter was last discussed in the House about 18 months ago. Since then there has been a further considerable drop. Foreign timber has been permitted to be freely imported and sold and that has led to a further fall in prices. There has also been, of course, the unfortunate windfall of very large areas in Scotland and that has also tended to put a considerable amount of timber prematurely on the market. In the previous debate, my hon. Friend said that the problem was urgent, that prices were falling and that unless something was done there would be little incentive for private owners, at any rate, to continue the planting they had done so well between the wars. Their record then was at least as good as, if not better than, that of the Forestry Commission. It was felt that that trend could not continue unless there was a reasonable return from the sale of the timber-not only because of lack of confidence but also because there would not be the finance available for the planting of new areas. If the problem was urgent 18 months ago, it has certainly become even more urgent today. Prices have fallen further. Although my hon. Friend then introduced that note of urgency, it was only a few weeks ago that a committee was set up to investigate the problem and to propose improved methods for marketing homegrown timber. This Motion today asks that the committee, having now been set up after the lapse of this fairly considerable time, should produce its report as soon as possible. Time is running out. The nation is very much concerned with all aspects of forestry policy. It affects everyone. Naturally, therefore, it is subject to a considerable degree of regulation. The forestry owner finds that his costs and prices are regulated in many directions. From a forestry point of view he is instructed what trees to fell and what trees not to fell. In the southern counties, or if he is anywhere near one of the National Parks, he is also frequently instructed by the town and country planing authorities on what trees he may not fell even though, from a forestry point of view, those trees may be mature and in a condition for felling. His principal outlay is on the wages of his men. Those wages are also fixed on a national basis. He has also to pay Schedule B taxation which, again, is regulated for him. Yet, with all these regulations imposed upon him in the national interest-and I would not argue against any of them-the sale of his product, by which he has to finance his operations, is not in any way supported or regulated on a national scale. His product has to compete on the open market with timber from foreign countries where conditions may be much easier and wage rates much lower. To me it rather seems that he is competing with one hand tied behind his back, while with his one free hand he has to try to get the finance to support his operations. I think that in this respect it can be said that the forestry industry receives less consideration than any other important national interest, and certainly compares very unfavourably with agriculture. In many ways it is parallel to, or a branch of, the agricultural industry, but whereas agricultural prices are guaranteed in return for various restrictions and regulations, in forestry this is not so. I believe that what is now required is a permanent national policy for the marketing of home-grown timber to give the whole industry confidence. This can only be done by arranging that the prices should stand at a better level than they do today. There are, I think on both sides of the House, many strong objections to any form of Exchequer subsidy, and therefore I return to the point that I briefly mentioned earlier. I should like to suggest the consideration of an import levy on imported timber, which represents over 90 per cent. of the timber we use in this country, and therefore the levy could be on a very low basis, in order to provide adequate finance to make our own timber industry remunerative and stable. Something of this kind worked very well under the Wheat Act in rather a comparable situation, where the imported product was in preponderance over the home-grown product. It is interesting to learn that a very small levy, as small as a penny a cubic foot, on imported timber would have introduced last year more money to the industry than all the Exchequer subsidies were able to do. Could that not be extended so that not only could the industry be put on a more remunerative basis and given more confidence, but also the Exchequer could possibly save all the money which has been spent in subsidies, thus effecting a dual purpose-the encouragement of further planting by private owners and the reduction of the present Exchequer payments to woodland owners? In the past the private owners have had an excellent record of replanting, but I think this has mainly been, since the war at any rate, because of tradition. These woodlands are largely in the hands of men who for many years have been brought up to replant where they have felled, and they probably find it rather difficult to change their ways even though they may begin to suspect that it is no longer economic to do so. I suggest that as new generations come along and as further death duties are paid, new owners of woodlands will have to consider the matter in the cold reality of economics, and they will appreciate that at present prices it cannot possibly be justified economically to replant on the scale that they have done in the past, which it is generally agreed they should continue to do in the national interest. I believe that some kind of a prop to the prices in this respect would give the incentive which is so badly required. I should like to know where the Conservative Party stands with regard to its pledge of putting the home producer first in the home market. Some kind of support of this kind, some kind of small levy on imported timber to support the price of home-produced timber, would be a very practical demonstration that this party believes in what it has always said about putting the home producer first. I wonder how the industry is being treated by the nationalised concerns which are such important consumers of home-grown timber. Is the home-grown producer really being put first in this respect? It has been suggested that a considerable quantity of imported hardwood is being used in the repair of railway wagons, some of which, at any rate, could be replaced by home-grown timber. I have also heard that the National Coal Board, which is the largest user of the thinnings from forests, when negotiating for the purchase of pit wood from home sources, is inclined to have very much in mind the possibility of buying its pit wood overseas. The National Coal Board does not always give the impression that it is going to consume all the home-produced pit wood that is available before turning to foreign sources. I cannot imagine any other country where it would be considered good policy to use a foreign product in a nationalised industry if it were possible to use its home product or before making sure that the whole of the home product had first been used. That brings me to the point of the disposal of thinnings, a large proportion of which are, or should be, inevitably consumed in the mines. From reports it would appear that the Forestry Commission is finding some difficulty in disposing of the whole of its thinnings to the National Coal Board. I should be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that point. I should like to know whether he is still satisfied that the National Coal Board will continue to be able to take up all of the future increased quantity of thinnings, or whether other outlets are going to be required. I now come to the field of the committee which has been set up and which will presumably investigate other possible outlets for thinnings and second-grade timber of that kind besides pit wood. Various suggestions have been made, such as the manufacture in this country of more hardboard from softwood thinnings and the manufacture of wood pulp for paper. I believe there is considerable doubt whether the hardboard and wall-board industry will be capable of taking up much of the home-produced thinnings, because in most cases these are produced in countries where there is a considerable amount of forestry waste which it is possible to put into the factories at negligible cost. Therefore, I doubt whether thinnings, which have to carry a considerable amount of overhead expenditure to get to our factories, could compete with pure waste from foreign countries. It seems doubtful whether that offers a very optimistic outlet for further thinnings. The pulp industry would seem to me to have better prospects. We all know that newspapers are very concerned about the shortage of pulp and the lack of newsprint. I am not suggesting that the small quantity that we shall produce in this country in the immediate future would make very much difference to the situation, but at least there is a strong demand. A very big proportion of what we now get comes from dollar sources, and perhaps some kind of pulping plant would be a valuable addition to the outlets for this kind of timber. The capital outlay for such plant would be considerable, and I suggest that the Minister might consider whether some kind of grants or loans could be given to selected companies in suitable areas by the timber trade for installing plant of this kind for pulping. I suggest that the Minister should also consider whether such grants could be made available under any present legislation, or whether there might be some possibility of using some of the American credit which, I think, could be used for this purpose, on experimental lines. A certain amount of unrest has been caused among the trade and among growers of timber because of the bad reputation of home-grown timber. This is certainly aggravated at the present time by the difficulty of obtaining felling licences for the better-class timber. It is easy to understand why that policy has been introduced; nevertheless, I should like the Minister to consider whether it might not now be good policy to allow a greater quantity of good timber to be felled in order gradually to rebuild the reputation of our home-grown timber, which certainly cannot be done whilst only the rather second-rate timber is licensed for felling. It is very important that our reputation should be re-established in these days, when marketing is becoming the most essential factor in any industry. If no really good product is available on the market, it is very hard for the home-grown timber trade to begin to rebuild its reputation. Even if only a comparatively small quantity of timber were involved, it would at least form a basis for large supplies of well-graded and good quality English timber which we hope to see coming in later years both from the Forestry Commission and from private owners. It is trite to say that many of our economic difficulties are the result of a lack of natural resources. In our forests and woodlands we have very valuable natural resources, which are greatly neglected by the nation. With a little more interest and concern by the Government and by those in authority-a little more help and a little more confidence in the industry-we could not only build up a wealth of natural timber for the future but could encourage a product which would strengthen our defences in an emergency and improve our balance of payments."];;neutral
1960-02-17a.1289.3.txt;;["With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to make a statement about a ballistic missile early warning station. Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the United States of America have reached agreement about setting up and operating a ballistic missile early warning station in the United Kingdom. This agreement is in support of the North Atlantic Treaty. The text of the Agreement is available as a White Paper in the Vote Office. The station will be sited on Government-owned land at Fylingdales Moor, in Yorkshire. It will give early warning of ballistic missile attacks on the United Kingdom. The station will also be the third in a chain giving early warning of ballistic missile attacks on the North American Continent. Thus, the two countries have a community of interest in its erection and operation. In providing additional protection for Western strategic deterrent forces, the station will contribute substantially to the security of the entire N.A.T.O. area. The station will be commanded and operated by the Royal Air Force. The information it obtains will be available simultaneously to operations centres in the United Kingdom and the United States. The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, will receive the warning generated by the system; and the United Kingdom will also have access to information provided by the other stations in the chain. The United States will provide and install the radars for the station, and pay for the communications required to link the station to the rest of the system. The United Kingdom will provide the land, erect the buildings, and provide communications required to link the station with our own authorities. For the first five years of operation, the cost of spares for the radars and other technical equipment will be borne by the United States Government, and the cost of the maintenance of this equipment on the site will be borne by the United Kingdom. The responsibility for these costs after the end of this period will be a matter for later review. The other running costs of the station will be borne by the United Kingdom Government. The capital cost of the station to this country is expected to be about GBP 8 million. The capital cost to the United States is expected to be about GBP 35 million. The Government greatly regret that the station has to be in part of a National Park. But the topographical, geographical, and the operational criteria governing the choice of site are extremely stringent, and after detailed examination, the Government are satisfied that there is no other suitable site in the whole country. The Fylingdales site comprises about four square miles of land, owned mainly by the War Office and partly by the Minister of Agriculture on behalf of the Forestry Commission, and is within a larger area which has been used by the War Office for military training. As the site is in a National Park, the Government undertake to demolish the buildings if at any time in the future the station is no longer required. The Air Ministry will discuss with the local authorities, and with the National Parks Commission and other amenity bodies, the detailed siting arrangements and measures to be taken to minimise the effect on the landscape."];;neutral
1961-03-29a.1485.3.txt;;['I am very glad tonight to have the opportunity of raising the question of afforestation in the National Parks areas, which to those who are concerned with amenity is a matter of national concern. It is a matter of special concern to the West Country where there are two National Parks, Dartmoor and Exmoor, and of particular interest to my constituency which includes 75 per cent. of Exmoor. I have one major point to make, which I shall make at the end of my speech, but, to lead up to it, I should like to describe the background of the matter. In the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture and forestry is not deemed to involve development of the land. Proposals for afforestation, therefore, do not require planning permission. In the National Parks, of which there are ten in the United Kingdom, and especially in the National Parks of Dartmoor and Exmoor, the question of development of forestry has become a burning local issue. The Minister of the day, in moving the Second Reading of the 1947 Bill, said that agriculture and forestry would always be the paramount form of activity and that he thought it right that that, and that alone, should be emphasised. There can be no quarrel with that statement. I firmly and absolutely support it. Indeed, I have every admiration for all those who resist encroachments upon the main purposes of the National Park areas, but, since those words were spoken in this House, the situation has changed. In those days the only people locally interested in forestry were the members of the Forestry Commission, which, clearly, is subject to control by the Government, and local landowners, who have always done such magnificent work in their localities. Today, there are proposals for large-scale afforestation by syndicates and other organisations. This has come as a shock to the people who live in these areas. They can see the whole character of their localities changing at the option of strangers. Yet only recently the question has become whether the control is satisfactory and they have been powerless to affect the situation. I say, in parentheses, that I have every sympathy for a landowner who wishes to resist additional forms of control. Goodness knows, we suffer today, even under a Conservative Government, from too many forms of control. None the less, I think that this is perhaps a situation where some form of control is necessary. The National Parks Commission thought so, also. It has spoken very strongly on this matter. To quote its eleventh Report, for the year ended 30th September, 1960, which was recently laid before this House: With the park planning authorities concerned, we had already given much time and thought to the problem posed by such large-scale private afforestation schemes, and we were much encouraged by the spontaneous and widespread concern for the National Parks. As the law now stands, the planting of trees is outside planning control, and it seemed to us, so far as the afforestation of previously unplanted land was concerned, the only satisfactory safeguard was some form of control. They made representations to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and represented that it was a matter of real urgency that a form of control should be introduced. We would not seek to maintain"- it says, that the designation of a National Park implies prohibition of afforestation in the area"- nor would I say so- nor that afforestation of necessity adversely affects the beauty of a landscape. But we do say that it is wrong in principle that it should be possible to change substantially the character of a landscape in a National Park, without affording those to whom the statutory responsibility of preserving the landscape has been entrusted any opportunity of considering the proposals. Those are certainly my views. Indeed, we do not see how it is possible to reconcile the absence of control with the duty laid upon the planning authority and upon ourselves by Parliament to secure the fulfilment of the objectives of preserving and enhancing the natural beauty of National Parks and promoting their enjoyment by the public. These are very strong words and they reflect the very real concern in many of these areas and particularly, I would say, in and around my own constituency. I speak with experience in these matters. I have attended meetings of Exmoor bodies like the Exmoor Society and I have been astonished at the depth and intensity of feeling expressed by them. I fully recognise that development of industry, new industry the forestry industry, in my constituency, and possibly in other parts of the West Country, would bring certain benefits. I admire the spirit of enterprise of those who are concerned in this matter, but there are also demerits. I do not know, quite frankly, whether there is a sufficient demand for the timber which these forests are to produce. Indeed, I wonder, particularly in view of Britain\'s association with the European Free Trade Area, whether this is, in fact, a commercial proposition at all. However, it is not a matter for us to decide tonight. Let us accept, on the one hand, that there are benefits, and that, on the other-and this is the view of local people-there are also demerits in the development of large-scale afforestation in these areas. In a memorandum put out by the Standing Committee on National Parks of the Councils for the Preservation of Rural England and Wales, which contains many matters with which I agree and some with which I disagree, I say frankly to the House, these points are made, and I think that they sum up the case very clearly: The blanketing out of open combes and hillsides by plantations of conifers, the construction of hard roads and bridges in furtherance of forestry operations, would completely change the character of the area. Most true. The fenced-in plantations of conifers, with the destruction of the natural flora"- Again, this must be true. and taken for forestry is land lost to agriculture". That, again, is true, and it seems ironical that this should be so in days when the Government with the support of Members on both sides of this House and representing hill areas are endeavouring to develop agriculture in those areas and spending a great deal of money on it. I know this to be so from my own experience: Even the highest land on Exmoor provides summer grazing, and the Moor supports huge flocks of sheep, which provide plentiful meat and wool of a quality widely renowned. It goes on to talk of wild life, the ponies and deer which are a part of the area. There can be no question at all that were afforestation carried on on a very great scale all these traditional things would be affected and affected seriously. I feel that the truth of this matter is not black and white. I have never felt that. It is very largely grey. There are advantages and disadvantages and one has to balance them, but I feel that there are substantial misunderstandings in this matter. I do not believe that those who are in favour of this large-scale afforestation have presented their case adequately from the public relations point of view to the people living locally, and I think that it is not unreasonable that people living locally should resent on the whole the incursion by strangers into their area. If the House accepts it is right that there should be some form of control, that the local people should have a right to control development in their area, the question is: what sort of control should there be? I suggest that it should be control only by people living locally, with the normal right of appeal to the Minister and should apply only to hitherto unplanted land in the National Parks. I had proposed to bring in a Bill a short time ago to give effect to just such ideas. This plea for control should not be regarded as the thin end of the wedge for bringing agriculture fully under planning control. I should be very strongly opposed to that. This is a planning problem, and it is unique. The National Parks Commission and those of us who have been interested in the question have made representations to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government on this matter over a period. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who has always listened to me with great courtesy, patience and understanding. In a Written Answer on 27th July, 1960, which appears in column 115 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, my hon. Friend said that discussions were taking place with the various interests concerned in the matter. At the end of January it reached. In answer to a Parliamentary Question was announced that agreement had been tabled by me we were given on 14th February a full description of the agreement, which I should like to go into. Paragraph 3 says: In order to try to avoid conflict between the needs of forestry and the preservation and enhancement of natural beauty, the parties to this agreement"- they are the Timber Growers\' Organisation, the Country Landowners\' Association, the Forestry Commission and the National Parks Commission- believe that the closest co-operation should be maintained between those concerned with afforestation and those responsible for accomplishing the purposes for which National Parks have been established. What could be better than that? It is an admirable statement of purpose. It is intended to have a survey to designate those areas upon which trees could be planted. It would also cover those areas which are perhaps not so likely to have trees planted upon them, and those areas which it is now quite unlikely will have trees planted upon them. It is a very sensible plan to get all the interests concerned together to discuss the matter. Paragraph 8 of the agreement says: Pending the completion of the surveys, which must, of necessity, take a considerable time"- that is one of the troubles- the Timber Growers\' Organisation and the Country Landowners\' Association will advise their members to consult the Park Planning Authorities about their afforestation proposals. Arrangements for such consultation will be made locally in each Park. So far, so good. Paragraph 7 contains this assurance: In case of disagreement at any stage, the good offices of the Government Departments concerned will be available". The memorandum goes on to make clear, if it should be necessary, that these arrangements will not apply outside the National Parks, nor do I believe that it is necessary that they should. I can sum up my feeling on the question of the voluntary agreement as follows. As a matter of principle, I am strongly in favour of voluntary agreements as opposed to legislation. I believe that we suffer too much from legislation in the House and in the country as a whole. I have always believed that a voluntary agreement is infinitely better than legislation. I am most anxious to see the agreement working successfully. There are people who condemn the agreement. I believe it is quite wrong to do so until it has had an opportunity to work and been given a fair trial. I am anxious to see it improved, if possible, because failure will be at the cost of the National Parks and not at the cost of forestry. There is a tendency in some quarters to suggest that anyone who criticises the voluntary agreement is either trying to sabotage it, or is attacking the good faith of the parties. These are certainly not my aims or intentions, and I am sure the Minister and the House will accept my assurance on the point. I want to point out the following things tonight. The agreement provides only for consultation. There are no sanctions for ensuring agreement. This inevitably places planning authorities in the National Parks in a weak position when it comes to negotiation. Also, the agreement is limited in its scope. It applies only to members of the Country Landowners\' Association, the Timber Growers\' Organisation and the Forestry Commission, as I pointed out, and it has no effect at all upon non-members of those organisations, of whom, I believe, there are several who are actively interested; certainly, there are some who are active in my part of the world. Nor does it apply to those members, as I understand, who may choose, without breach of faith, not to take part in the scheme. I believe that those are serious demerits in the agreement, and I hope that the situation can be improved. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman) referred recently to a particular case which has arisen. The hon. Member has always taken a keen interest in the subject, and I congratulate him on his efforts. The local National Park Committee is firmly opposed to afforestation on a part of High House Moor, on Dartmoor, yet it is understood that the local developer intends to proceed with his plans nevertheless. That is most unsatisfactory. I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will devote his attention to that matter and see whether, under paragraph 7 of the agreement, he can use his good offices to have matters put right. It is extremely important, if the agreement is to be a success, that we in the House of Commons-the Minister, in particular, and all of us who are interested in the subject-should express clearly and firmly our determination now to make it work. Otherwise, it will become a dead letter and irreparable harm will be done. The zoning proposals might be dangerous in the sense that, in the case of areas zoned, presumably, as suitable for afforestation, there will be no control, so it seems from the agreement, on the choice of species or on the landscaping of any planting schemes which may be undertaken. This, again, is something to which attention should be directed. If it is possible to improve the agreement in that respect, we should do so. I have made it clear, I hope, that I am a supporter of the agreement. I have made it clear, I hope, that I am most anxious to see it work. For myself-and I believe that I speak in this for many other hon. Members-I shall do all I can to see that it does work. I feel, however, that this point should be made. If the agreement does not work, what then? I hope that we shall tonight have an assurance from my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary either that he would introduce legislation on the subject along the lines I have indicated or, alternatively, that he would support any attempt made by a private Member of the House, whether myself or anybody else, to do so. I very much hope that such legislation would not be opposed by the Government. I believe that the beauty of our country is a great heritage. In the National Parks and in other parts of the country, too, that great heritage is being preserved. I am most anxious to see it preserved. Hence my reason for raising the matter tonight, and my anxiety to make certain that we in the House of Commons do not permit a situation to arise which would have the effect, even in the slightest degree, of cutting across or impairing the tremendously valuable work which the National Parks Commission is doing to preserve that heritage for the future.'];;neutral
1962-11-30a.811.6.txt;;['I beg to move, That this House congratulates the National Parks Commission on their progress over the past 13 years in furthering the purposes set out in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949; considers that time has shown the need for amendment of the Act in a number of respects, so as to facilitate the extension and diversification of the activities of the Commission and, particularly, with regard to the existing financial arrangements; and urges Her Majesty\'s Government to introduce amending legislation accordingly. It is now thirteen years since Parliament, with all-party support, created the National Parks Commission. Having been fortunate enough to draw a place in the Ballot, I felt that it would be useful to assess the value of the Commission and its work over the years and to ask, in the light of that experience, whether the 1949 Act stands in need of amendment. I should say straight away that I approach this subject in all humility, because it is one of immense complexity. The Act itself has 115 Sections and two Schedules. I know that there are many hon. Members who were present during the Second Reading debate of that Bill and who have expert knowledge. The right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) was even a sponsor of a Bill to obtain access to mountains in this country as long back as 1930. I know also that there are many hon. Members who, like myself, have National Parks within their constituencies, and no doubt they will be able to speak of their own personal experiences of the operation of the Act in their own areas. I have the privilege of representing part of Exmoor, which I drive over fortnightly on the way to my constituency, which I shall in fact drive through tonight, which I know well and love deeply. I shall not go into particular details in regard to Exmoor but try to keep to more general principles and leave it to other hon. Members to deal with their own personal experiences. I have received representations from many admirable bodies interested in the National Parks-the National Trust, the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Ramblers\' Association, the Council for Nature and others. Obviously, it is not possible within the compass of one speech to deal with the many valuable and interesting points which have been raised. Nor, indeed, do I think that I need go into the history of the great pioneers who helped to set up the idea of National Parks-James Bryce, through the Addison, Dower and Hobhouse Reports, finally to the introduction by Mr. Silkin, as he then was, of the Bill in 1949. During the Second Reading debate, Mr. Silkin pointed out that this was one of the most densely populated countries in the world, that four-fifths of our population lived in urban areas, and that the object of the Bill was to preserve and enhance the beauty of the countryside; and, secondly, to enable our people to see it, get to it, and enjoy it"-[OFFICIAL REPORT. 31st March, 1949; Vol. 463, c. 1462.] It was for those who feel the need, in the words of Cicero, to fly from the town to the country as though from chains. It is certainly right and proper that the people of this country should be able to enjoy the one benefit bestowed on them by our appalling climate. Since then ten National Parks have been designated-the Peak District, which is of easy access to people living in the great centres of population like Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke; the Lake District, 900 square miles; Snowdonia, of which Hilaire Belloc said that there was no corner in Europe which moved him more than the "awe and majesty of the North Wales mountains seen from the corner of their silent sea." Then there is Dartmoor, represented by the hon. Baronet the Member for Tavistock (Sir H. Studholme), whom I see in his place; the Pembrokeshire coast; the North York Moors; the Yorkshire moors; Exmoor; Northumberland, and the Brecon Beacons. It is some of the finest countryside in these islands, an area which covers one-tenth of England and Wales. Scotland is not within the purview of the 1949 Act, although I shall not go into the reasons for that. I should like to clear up one or two misapprehensions. First the term "National Park" is, in itself, misleading. A park normally connotes some form of nature reserve, such as one finds in parts of America and Africa, whereas, in the Act, a National Park is defined as being &#8230; an extensive area of outstanding beauty, suitable for recreation but where the life of the existing community goes on. As the Hobhouse Report says: National Parks must not be sterilised as museum specimens. Farming and essential industries must flourish, unhampered by unnecessary controls and restrictions and protected as far as possible from inconveniences that might arise from an increased number of visitors. When one realises that, one realises what a very delicate balance has to be maintained between the various interests. First, there are the needs of the agricultural community, whose people have tilled the soil for centuries, long before the idea of National Parks was conceived. There are the rural inhabitants who make their livelihood in those areas in their different ways. There is the nation at large, and there is the effect of the influx of visitors, which may well change the landscape, and could provide some inconvenience to the indigenous population. The job of the National Parks Commission and, through it, the Park planning authorities, is to maintain this very delicate balance. The Commission, as such, is not a planning authority. As the House well knows, each National Park has its own separate planning authority, or, in cases where more than one county is involved, there may be several planning authorities, and two-thirds of those are appointed from the elected members of the county council, and only one-third are appointed by the local planning authority, on the nomination of the Minister, on the advice of the Commission. Therefore, when brickbats are thrown at the Commission for certain planning permissions, the fault very often does not lie in the Commission. The criticism should be directed to the elected members of the county council, who have the majority representation on those authorities. The House should also bear in mind that the planning authorities themselves have no power to control the agricultural use to which land can be put, because agricultural use of land is not "development" within the meaning of the Town and Country Planning Act. The Commission cannot own land. Its chief task is to act in an advisory capacity, not only in regard to National Parks but areas of outstanding natural beauty, and areas of England and Wales generally, on any issue involving natural beauty. We have moved a very long way to accepting the need for planning to maintain the beauty of our countryside. As the present Minister pointed out in the Adjournment debate on 29th March, 1961, 5 per cent. of our land is now designated as being of outstanding natural beauty, 6 per cent. is accounted for by the green belt and 9 per cent. by National Parks. That means that 20 per cent. of our land is under the strictest possible control, bearing in mind the balance that has to be maintained between all the conflicting interests. At any rate, there is a realisation of the duty on planning authorities to maintain the beauty of the countryside. How have our National Parks failed since the coming into operation of the 1949 Act? They have sustained a substantial number of invasions, from pylons for the super-grid to overhead distribution lines. We have seen a proliferation of masts for the General Post Office, the Ministry of Aviation and the Air Ministry. In Dartmoor, we have a 750 ft. television mast on Hessary Tor. In Snowdonia, we have a nuclear electricity generating station and a pumped storage installation. The Service Ministries have training rights over 410,000\' acres, and 25 of their training areas are within National Parks. The Minister has to decide which intrusions are in the vanguard of social progress and which are downright vandalism. It was Lord Strang, Chairman of the National Parks Commission, who said to the Ramblers on 29th September last: Where a Government Department has plans for erecting large installations of one kind or another in a National Park I can remember no case where it has been diverted from its purpose by anything the Commission might say about the intentions of Parliament as embodied in the National Parks Act. Coming as that does from one who spent many distinguished years as a careful draftsman in the Foreign Office, I do not think that anyone could accuse Lord Strang of verbal flamboyance, and I think that that considered view is a very great criticism of the way in which successive Ministers have allowed invasions to take place within the National Park. Today, the State is driven on by an almost insatiable appetite for more water, more electric power, more land for forestry, more wireless communications, and I ask the House what the picture within the National Parks will be in 20 years\' time. Will there be a conglomeration of pylons, reservoirs, concrete posts and pig wire, or shall we see the National Parks preserved? One must, however, balance the position. The situation is not all black. There have been some notable achievements in regard to planning, where credit is due to the Minister, to Select Committees of this House and of another place, and where, also, the advice of the Commission has been invaluable. As we know, a House of Lords Select Committee recently threw out a Bill that sought to create an aerodrome at Harrobeer in the Dartmoor National Park, and a similar fate met the Torquay Water Bill when it came before a Select Committee of this House. Another place saw to it, after a brilliant speech by the late Lord Birkett, which was the peroration of his life, that Manchester should not be allowed to plunder water from the Lake District. The Minister has recently refused to allow increased quarrying of limestone in the southern part of the Peak District, and there have been many cases where derelict property has been cleared and where electricity boards have agreed to lay their electric lines underground; where, for example, as a result of consultation with the Forestry Commission, the Exmoor Chains are to be spared being smothered in conifers, and where, by screening, by adapting plans and by rerouting, the damage to the landscape has been minimised. I say at once that some intrusions into the National Parks are inevitable. In my own constituency, I have many villages that are without piped water arid without an electricity supply. Who is to say that it is wrong that those villages should receive the essential services? It is essential that many rural areas should have better roads, especially those that are threatened with railway branch line closures and to which one is trying to attract light industry in order to provide alternative employment. If these essential services are not provided, we shall see increased depopulation of these rural areas. In my division, I have villages with populations smaller now than they were a hundred years ago. We must recognise that if rural depopulation proceeds apace, that, in itself, deprives the National Parks of one of their vital and virile assets, because it is a vigorous, healthy rural community and a vigorous rural village life that gives part of the character and charm to Our National Parks. We have to realise, therefore, that this is a very difficult balance. I hope that in future the Minister of Housing and Local Government will be tougher than some of his colleagues and particularly with the Service Ministers. It is true that they have released about 100,000 acres in the last few years, but I was not particularly pleased to read the speech by the General Officer Commanding Northern Command when he said that the Army was very short of training ground and would probably need more. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what are the intentions of his right hon. Friends the Service Ministers. Is it to continue a phased withdrawal, or will their appetite, on the contrary, grow? I should like to touch on certain specific problems which I believe face the Commission. The first is inadequate finance. The second is the need to amend the Act. The third is the prickly and controversial question of ploughing and afforestation. The fourth relates to the constitution of the Park planning authorities. On finance, the Report of the Addison National Park Committee in 1931 suggested that the figure which would be required would be GBP 100,000 per annum for the first five years. It also suggested a utility scheme of GBP 10,000 per annum for the same period. The Report of the Hobhouse National Parks Committee (England and Wales) suggested that GBP 9&#188; million would be necessary for capital expenditure for the first ten years and that administrative costs would be at the rate of GBP 170,000 a year for the first full year, rising to GBP 750,000 a year after the fourth year. Mr. Dalton, as he then was, suggested that the Land Fund might become available. I know that this is a question which the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Hayman), who has been a great protector of National Parks, raised in a speech on 30th March, 1961. I leave that point with him if he chooses to raise it. The House knows that certain schemes carried out by the Park planning authorities are grant-aided with 75 per cent. contribution from the Exchequer and 25 per cent. from the county council or county councils, whichever the case may be. It is interesting to assess what the income and expenditure of the National Parks Commission and the Park planning authorities has been for the twelve years, 1949 to 1961, bearing in mind at all times the suggestions in the Addison and Hob-house Reports as to what the level of expenditure should be. First, with regard to the Commission, the cost of administration, Which includes Stationery Office expenses, has been GBP 346,229. Publicity is largely on the C.O.I. Vote and costs GBP 24,489, making a total expenditure for the administrative costs of the Commission of GBP 370,718. That, of course, comes from taxation, that is, a direct Exchequer grant, and works out at roughly GBP 30,000 per annum. As for the Park planning authorities, Exchequer grants, Which include grants for areas of outstanding national beauty and long distance routes, have been GBP 53,274 and the local authority\'s share of 25 per cent. has been GBP 17,758.'];;positive

1975-03-05a.1625.2.txt;;["-in England and Scotland, I should like to say that not only has it tried in the past to have talks with the Inland Revenue on the question of alleged tax avoidance but it also positively welcomes the five-year rule which has now been proposed as a means of putting an end to death bed purchases. It would be ungracious not to acknowledge that there has been some response from the Government in the form of the new clause and schedule which have appeared on the Notice Paper. At the same time, it would be hypocritical not to say that the Bill as originally presented was an outrage to the forestry industry. It would be untrue to say that the clause and schedule now presented go any appreciable way towards removing this evil. The clause has a title to the effect that it is a relieving clause. This at once raises the question, as it appears to affect only cases of transfer on death, whether it is intended that transfers in life should remain under the main charging provisions. If this is so, surely the clause is immediately at fault in inhibiting such transfers and ossifying the private forestry industry. The Government measures are apparently directed against owners. The Chief Secretary must realise that the real victims of this will be all sections engaged in the private forestry industry and, most of all, the forestry workers. I have had letters from the Economic Forestry Group, the Woodland Management Association Limited, the Flintshire Woodlands Limited, and the Association of Professional Foresters. The Association of Professional Foresters, together with the British Foresters Action Group, represents about 10,000 workers employed in the forestry industry. The Chief Secretary should hear just one or two things that the Association of Professional Foresters has said in a letter to myself which arrived this morning: the grossing up principle which is inherent in the capital transfer tax will place a very high tax burden on woodlands. However, by far the most &#8230; disastrous principle appears to have been &#8230; that the tax will be assessed on the sale value of the timber. &#8230; Inevitably therefore, all future forestry will take place on a short term rotation &#8230; those people who derive their livelihood from the private sector of British forestry are likely to lose their jobs, and also cause heavy depopulation in the rural areas &#8230; the traditionally long term hardwood rotation will cease and be succeeded by soft woods on a short term rotation. There will be no replacement of long term hardwood woodlands such as areas of Beech, Oak, etc.&#8230;We trust that you will find time to try to ensure that the livelihood of those employed in forestry is safeguarded and that the future landscape of the country is protected. It is clear from the clause and the schedule that many of the practical implications have not been thought out. The 45 per cent. relief on agricultural land which hitherto has been available also for forestry land has been lost. No alternative form of relief has been substituted. It is surely reasonable to ask that as long as land remains committed to forestry it should receive the same treatment for capital transfer tax purposes as the trees grown thereon-that is, that it should be left out of account in determining the value transferred on death and tax charged only if and when it is sold. Nothing has been considered, apparently, with regard to underwood. This has never been subject to estate duty. It is now to be made liable to the tax. The deductions allowable from the proceeds of sale are considerably less generous than those which were permitted in the case of estate duty. The clause appears to cover only the case of woodlands owned by individuals and not to deal with trusts and companies. There is no mention of the things which are bound to happen in forestry, mostly windfalls and losses resulting from windblows. It has been suggested that the new clause appears to relieve only dedicated woodlands. This is surely nonsense in a fiscal context. Whatever the advantages of dedication, it is surely nonsense that the existence or not of dedication should determine a liability to tax. Quite apart from other considerations, the main object of the dedication scheme has always been the use of the land for timber production. It is the land-not the trees-which is dedicated. Many amenity woods, small woods, copses, and all hedgerow and park timber have been deliberately kept outside the scheme. The trees and woods involved account for about 29 per cent. of all privately-owned timber, and for 37 per cent. of all hardwoods growing in Great Britain. Unless such timber is to be penalised as regards capital transfer tax, with disastrous consequences for the appearance of the countryside, the rules of the dedication scheme will require substantial modification, and all restrictions on what can and cannot be dedicated will have to be lifted. Whether this is practicable, whether it will be welcome to the Forestry Commission as the authority responsible for the administration of the scheme, and whether the scheme will benefit as a result are all open questions. I come to the major objections which have already been referred to in the letter which I read from the association representing forestry workers. There are two main objections-first, the question of the basis of value on which the tax is to be paid, and, secondly, the question of the rate at which the tax is to be paid. As regards the basis of value, it is proposed that the deferred tax should be chargeable not on the value of the trees at the time of death but on the proceeds of their eventual sale. The latter value, due to the growth of the trees in the interval, could be anything up to 10 or more times higher than the former. It is thus the intention to tax values which to a greater or lesser extent will have been non-existent at the time when the transfer took place-that is, at the date of death. This is patently unjust and contrary to the principles of the capital transfer tax, and will place on forestry a tax burden suffered by no other industry. There is no comparison with the objects dealt with in Clause 31, which can be left out of account in determining the value of the transfer on death, but in the case of which, if they are subsequently sold, the proceeds of sale rather than the value at death become chargeable to tax. The second question is the rate of duty. This is the second serious short- coming in the Government's new clause; namely, the proposal to charge the tax on the proceeds of eventual sales at the rate applicable to the top slice of the estate transferred on death. I take it that there can be three ways in which the rate could have been fixed. It could have been done by reference to the average rate on the main estate. It could have been done by assessment on the timber as a separate estate, or it could have been done at the highest rate of the main estate. The Government have chosen the third and most onerous of those three methods. The extraordinary situation could arise, as a result of these Government proposals, that in cases where woodlands are divided and left to more than one individual, the felling or selling decisions of any one of the beneficiaries will affect the capital transfer tax liability of the others. I sum up in this way the case which the Government must accept before this tax passes into law. In view of the nature of the tax, the only just basis for levying it is on the value at the date of transfer, and in these circumstances the simplest and fairest method for dealing with the problem is to treat the timber as a separate estate but without the benefit of the GBP 15,000 exemption limit."];;neutral
1975-03-21a.2163.2.txt;;['I beg to move, That this House regrets the division of Ministerial responsibility by which the national heritage in private hands is threatened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer\'s capital transfer tax (despite the New Clause added to the Finance Bill), and that what remains in private hands, following the imposition of CTT, is threatened by the wealth tax which promises to remove the remaining resources of private persons preserving the national heritage for public benefit; further regrets that whilst the Secretary of State for the Environment through the Historic Buildings Councils endeavours with slender resources to prevent the decay and loss of historic buildings of outstanding importance, there is little liaison with the Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of Education and Science, who has responsibility for the Arts, which could be enjoyed by a far wider audience than at present if more use was made of existing historic buildings to house the arts in the form of music, drama, painting and sculpture where these things find a more sympathetic home than in the expensive clinical conditions of modern purpose-built buildings which Great Britain in her present state of economic stress can ill afford when faced with the pressing need to finance the National Theatre, now nearing completion, in a manner which will enable it to meet the expectations of the public who have waited for 117 years for the opening and the need to maintain all those other British artistic institutions whose present standards compare favourably with anywhere in the world; and calls upon Her Majesty\'s Government to give urgent consideration to the question of Ministerial responsibility with a view to making better use of existing resources to the benefit of the people whose interests this Government claims to serve. By a happy chance, we find ourselves with enough time to look at a big subject in more leisurely fashion than I had hoped. Seeing the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Jenkins) taking his place on the Government Front Bench, and having in mind the expanded form of motion which I put on the Order Paper for fear that I should never be allowed to make a speech on the subject this afternoon, I almost live in hope that I shall receive a reply by a Minister of State in charge of the arts and the national heritage, and I am tempted for a moment to think that I see that Minister in the presence of the hon. Gentleman. However, having had some experience over a fairly long time in the House. I fear that I have not so quickly achieved my aim and I understand that, in fact, the Minister with responsibility for the arts is here this afternoon to look after the affairs of the Department of the Environment. I understand that Department\'s difficulties in sending a Minister to the House for an occasion which might not even materialise, and I can only hope that those at work in it are usefully employed elsewhere in looking after the national heritage. We should not have half the problems to which I shall refer if there were a Minister whose influence and scope covered the subjects under discussion. I want to develop that theme at some length. However, before doing so I should ask the Minister about a vital matter which affects many people in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. King), who has the added advantage of an hon. Friend in the House today who can ask the Minister a direct question about a pressing local problem which has national significance. This is Architectural Heritage Year Europe, and yet we understand from this morning\'s Western Gazette that 35 masons, sawyers and labourers have been served with redundancy notices by the Portland stone firms. That is a pretty depressing picture in Architectural Heritage Year Europe, and I believe that the Under-Secretary of State, through his colleagues in the Department of the Environment, could do something about it at once. There is a contract for the Crown offices at Cathays Park, Cardiff, for which the Property Services Agency of the Department of the Environment is responsible. I believe that the stonework for that project which will be needed in early 1976 could well be embarked upon now, thus keeping these valuable men in work. The Minister will know that if skilled men are lost from an industry of ancient skills it is possible that they will never return in better times. That leads me to make another suggestion. Stonework has a habit of keeping for a very long time, and I should have thought that it would not be impossible for the Government to keep the stone firms and a number of other craft industries in work preparing stonework to be put into works of restoration or new construction perhaps some years ahead. Indeed, some restoration work of historic buildings is much better done with stonework which has been cut out of the quarry and worked and left to season. Some of the stark new work would not look so stark and new if it had been able to weather at Portland, where there is plenty of space for stone to weather. I hope that the Minister will give special attention to this matter. If he has not already thought about it, there is time for him to inquire of the Department of the Environment and give an answer today. I began by saying that I believed there should be one Minister with responsibility for the arts and the national heritage. The Government invented the phrase "national heritage ", and I suppose that they know what it means. It is not a particularly attractive phrase, but no one has come up with a better phrase. It is the bringing together of a number of Government activities which have a profound effect on our lives. That. I believe, is the next sensible step. I have tried to raise debates with various Government Departments and Ministers over quite a long time. Now, a debate on a subject for which the Department of the Environment has considerable responsibility is being answered by the Minister responsible for the arts. That is perhaps a good beginning. To bring the more civilised aspects of Government activity back into the mainstream of politics would be no bad thing. The public certainly require that they should be brought back into the mainstream. There is immense public interest in every aspect of parks and the national heritage. But Government activity is not yet properly co-ordinated. Ministerial responsibility for the arts has been an up-and-down affair. Originally the matter came under the Treasury, which can be more civilised than some people might think. Then there was an Under-Secretary in the Department of Education who was raised to the rank of Minister of State. When the Conservative Party returned to office we had the Paymaster-General, but he was in the other place. Then for a brief period it was a Minister of State, again at the Department of Education. I do not want to hurt the Under-Secretary of State\'s feelings when I say that he has been returned to the rank where all this began. I know that a Minister\'s influence to some degree de- pends on his personality and drive, but a Government are a somewhat hierarchical institution and a Minister of State would be able to achieve more than an Under-Secretary with less effort. Whereas an Under-Secretary has to fight hard to get things moving, a Minister of State has something of an advantage. The Minister responsible for the arts has no authority in decisions which are vital to a wider field of enjoyment than the things which he seeks to promote. Museums, galleries and theatres house the arts and the Under-Secretary is to some extent responsible for them, but these are complementary to the original homes of the arts-the palaces and historic houses, where much that we term art was originally produced. They still play a great part, but they could play a far greater part. The formation by my party of the Department of the Environment at last brought a lot of civilised activity under one head. It prevented the conservationists in the old Ministry of Public Building and Works from being defeated by the Ministry of Transport driving a road through what had been conserved. But that Department must be judged a vast affair in which some of the quieter subjects seem easily to get lost. I believe that the relationships between the arts and their original homes, many of which are under the wing of the Department of the Environment, could produce a much more fruitful future with more ministerial cultivation. Historic buildings, representing as they do the finest craftsmanship that their owners could find, filled with the best works of art then obtainable and added to by succeeding generations, make them in effect into galleries and museums which existed long before most of our public collections were even thought of. The Minister will recognise that the national collections for which he is responsible contain principally works of art which have been wrenched from the historic buildings for which they were created. Comparatively few works of art in our national collections were created with a public gallery in mind. All this leads me to suggest that historic houses are far better places in which to see works of art than are the some- what antiseptic conditions of public galleries. There have been politicians-I will not say where I think they came from-who were very keen to drag away everything in private ownership and take it off to public collections, but now the public collections themselves say that they could not possibly cope with this situation, so I hope that the Government will think again. There are already encouraging signs in that direction. Two other aspects of Government activity are involved-the regional arts associations, under the Under-Secretary, and the British Tourist Authority, with its various tourist boards, under another Department. There is no doubt that the activities of the regional associations could be based far more on existing historic buildings in public and principally in private ownership. It would be far better to have a concert or exhibition at a stately home, where it could be enjoyed together with all the other things that such a place has to offer. I am not suggesting that it should be in conjunction with the zoo park associated with some stately homes. The majority of places do not have that sort of thing. That is where the regional arts should be directing their attention. They could achieve far more at much less cost than they would be able to do on the slender resources, a lot of them contributed reluctantly by local authorities with a separate empire of officialdom. That shades off into regional tourist boards. There should be much more collaboration between tourist boards, the regions, regional arts associations and the owners of historic buildings. People come to Britain to see what? We are told that it is the theatre which comes first. We had a debate on that this week. The next attraction is the national heritage. How necessary it is to co-ordinate our efforts in that direction. I could spend the rest of the afternoon happily talking about the problems of historic buildings. Perhaps we can have another debate on that subject later. We have had some helpful noises from the Government during the course of the Finance Act through this House, particularly during the debate on the capital transfer tax. The Select Committee considering the wealth tax is now wading through many problems, one of which is the national heritage. If the Minister had been present at the public hearings of that Committee this week he would have heard the Inland Revenue agree that if there were a thousand major historic houses threatened by the wealth tax-that is not an exaggerated estimate-and if they all presented the same sort of problems as Hevening-ham, of which the Minister will have knowledge-Heveningham costs the Department of the Environment GBP 30,000 a year and is an empty shell with some furniture in it-it would not be difficult to imagine that it would cost the nation GBP 30 million a year to maintain those historic houses if private ownership was destroyed by the taxes the Government are determined to institute and if no exemptions were granted. Of course exemptions in conjunction with proper safeguards for increased public access are provided-although public access to the vast majority is not difficult now. I am glad that the Minister responsible for the arts is taking an interest in this, because there is not much point in another part of his Department spending GBP 30,000 a year on an increasing number of Heveninghams if it is not used to doing so. This is where the Minister comes in. I suppose that there is no direct Government responsibility for great cathedrals, although there is a semiofficial interest in redundant churches. Historic buildings of all kinds are becoming more involved with government in one way or another. The Historic Buildings Council is tentatively moving towards a policy of helping buildings of an ecclesiastical nature. I wonder whether we make proper use of our churches-the ones still in use for worship, and long may they remain so-and the redundant ones. It ought to be possible to have a series of splendid concerts in our great cathedrals. They stand half empty for half of the time and completely empty for a lot of the time. They are splendid places for the performance of many great musical works such as Berlioz\'s "Te Deum" which, the Minister will have heard, has been completely recorded for the first time. What a splendid event it would be if it could be performed in every one of our cathedrals in turn. Why not have a tour of cathedral concerts inspired by the Minister for the Arts? He might be able to find the necessary equipment which could travel around with the orchestra, because it would be pointless to have a special set of fittings made for every cathedral. The Minister may say that he is not responsible for that. However, as Minister responsible for the arts he must have an interest in all artistic activity wherever it takes place. The Minister might direct his attention to the Musicians\' Union. Sometimes the attitude of union members is self-defeating. Television provides a great opportunity for the arts. However, sometimes the unions make it almost impossible for concerts and opera to be broadcast because they demand fees which the television companies are not prepared to meet. The musicians should be persuaded that if they were prepared to see their work on television several times in exchange for more money, that would be of benefit both to the viewer and to the musician. However, at present there are too few opportunities of seeing such productions on television because of the musicians\' restrictive attitude. It is no good the Minister saying that it is all too difficult. It is not difficult if union members are given a financial inducement to perform. The Minister will be able to decide how that can be done, so that their work will reach millions of people by means of television when musicians can otherwise hope to reach only thousands during a lifetime. The Minister is responsible for local museums. He informed me in reply to a Question that museums were primarily the responsibility of the local authorities. However, I am sure that he is still interested in museums. If he has any resources, I am sure he will help local authorities with their conservation services, since much lies mouldering in the basements of museums which never sees the light of day, and probably never will, because it will have mouldered away. Can the Minister do more to foster the activities of local museums so that they can become a significant part of the communities in which they are situated? There are splendid examples of private enterprise museums in Dorset and in Kendal. Some municipal museums are good, while others are very bad. I hope that the Minister will lean upon local authorities and persuade them to make better use of their facilities. Museums should provide centres for local amenity societies formed by happy bands of people, which have sprung up in almost every part of the United Kingdom. I wonder why there are so many amenity societies. I believe the reason is the failure of the planners and of officialdom to take people into their confidence. It is not surprising when we see the frustrations which the morass of planning law has produced. There is too much attention to petty detail and not enough vision. The building regulations are applied in the most insensitive fashion by many local authorities. I wonder how many of them know that they can waive the building regulations in respect of any historic building. There is no need to put an aluminium picture window in the middle of a Tudor cottage. That process should he stopped, not encouraged. Sympathetic local materials can be used. That brings me back to the Portland stone argument. I do not refer to local stone ground up and pressed into uniform concrete blocks, because that is not a use of local materials in the true spirit of all the possibilities. Grants can be made to encourage the use of local materials. Planners spend a good deal of time preventing new building. I wonder whether they pay attention to the removal of eyesores. All too often the atmosphere of a village is destroyed by a misplaced filling station or a building of that kind. I hope that the Minister will give a gentle nudge to the Department of the Environment to deal effectively with these matters. Financial incentives can be given to owners to clean and improve their properties. I do not refer to the mere dishing out of taxpayers\' money, but perhaps one could say to them that if they provided something which was of community benefit from which they got a small return, they should not be taxed on that return. I hope that the Minister will look at that. I want to leave the Minister time in which to make a brief reply. My last topic concerns the countryside as a whole. The landscape which we enjoy today was substantially man-made, except perhaps in the rugged North. Most of the landscape enjoyed by most people today was substantially man-made, but it was created to suit an agricultural economy, which has changed out of all recognition. The picturesque gives way to the practical. I wonder how much the Forestry Commission is doing to plant for the future the hardwoods, possibly even the avenues, that we enjoy today. The avenues of the future should be planted today. I am prepared to bet that not one avenue of 100 yards was planted in Tree Year-" Plant a tree in \'73 "-certainly not by a public authority. There may have been some private patrons who did. There is an avenue of monkey puzzles about 300 yards long in Scotland. I am not suggesting that we need another avenue of monkey puzzles. We have got one. But perhaps we should plant one now for the future. Let us try to improve the landscape. What about the desecrations? Why do we not have all the hellish things in one place? Why not have the road, the line of pylons and the railway all in one place? All too often one hears of a splendid village having its views ruined by pylons. The planners say "It has not got the road or the railway. It must have the pylons." What nonsense that is. I hope that the Minister will not forget about archaeology. These days, we destroy so much without knowing what was there before. Recently, a little booklet about New Palace Yard has been published by the Department of the Environment. I hope that a little money will be made available to help local authorities to record what they are wiping out. I hope that some thought will be given to ways in which we can prevent people destroying that which they seek to enjoy. I am not suggesting restricted access to the countryside. That would be a most repressive measure. But we could do more with our modern aids to tell people who are setting off for the Lake District that 3 million people are already there that day and that perhaps they might choose another day on which to go. That is quite a long catalogue. I hope that we shall now have a considered reply from the Minister. I remind him that there was an article in a newspaper recently entitled, Is Architectural Heritage Year a sham? \' I hope that it is not a sham. I intend to return to that subject in some detail. But I hope that I shall hear today that the Minister will at least give all these matters some thought.'];;negative
1980-04-18a.1687.1.txt;;["The hon. Gentleman is pushing me into areas into which I should not wander this morning. That is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Minister. Hon. Members and members of the agriculture industry are aware that all is not well with the CAP. We must get it right. We must improve it and keep niggling away at it until it is right. No one knows that better than my right hon. Friend. Thirdly, my right hon. Friend has increased milk prices twice during the period in which he has been in office. There was an increase of 1 1/2p in June 1979 and 1 1/2p in February this year. That has raised the price of milk by 22 per cent. in the interests of the industry. Unusually, and to help further, maximum wholesale prices for milk set for the winter period will continue throughout the summer to the considerable benefit of milk producers. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West spoke about taxation. While the Budget Statement did not contain measures specifically aimed at the agriculture industry, many changes will affect farmers and landlords, in common with other businesses. Apart from general income tax changes, farmers will benefit from improved pension relief provisions. Growth of small farming companies may be encouraged by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's measures to help small businesses. The capital taxation threshold has been doubled and the threshold for capital gains tax raised. I appreciate-I know that the hon. Member for Cardigan will agree-that costs have risen substantially this year and that interest rates are higher than anyone in the farming industry wishes to see them. The prime aim of the Government has been to contain rising inflation, and we have to bear these difficulties and handicaps while that is being achieved. I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor will ease interest rates as soon as possible, but it is not for me to speculate when. I mention in passing the role the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service and the part played by it in conservation under the terms of the Countryside Act 1968. When advising farmers, it has to bear in mind possible repercussions on the environment. I should like to recall its service to agriculture. I turn now to proposed legislation on wildlife and the countryside. The hon. Member for Rother Valley was anxious that this legislation should be introduced in this Session of Parliament. It was purely because of congestion in the legislative programme that it had to be postponed. The hon. Gentleman said that all the agencies were looking forward to the legislation and that they had considered all the consultative papers on it. However, sometimes when one hears their comments, one wonders whether they want the legislation. The time that was available because of the delay has not been wasted. We have continued our consultations, and we shall publish papers this spring on the proposals. There was concern among people who wanted this legislation about our proposals for moorland conservation, and the way in which they differed from the proposals in the previous Government's Bill on the subject. This is an area where the farmers' natural wish to improve the productivity of their holdings has caused some controversy in Exmoor. The Porchester report dealt with the subject. We have said that we regard the conservation of Exmoor's characteristic moorland scenery as very important, but we have not seen the need to seek compulsory powers. The moorland has relatively few owners and occupiers, and after meeting some of them last July I was convinced that they would respond to voluntary management agreements. I understand that the National Park Authority will be publishing a schedule showing all the notifications that farmers or land owners have made of their wish to improve moorland since the Porchester report. This will also show that since last July there has been no further ploughing of the moorland without the agreement of the National Park Authority. That is most encouraging, and very much the trend I hoped we would achieve. It is a convincing indication of our belief that the farmers and landowners of Exmoor can be relied upon not to destroy the moor, without any need for compulsory action by the Government. There are a number of management agreements under negotiation, although no fresh ones have been signed in recent months. To highlight the strength of our feelings about the critical areas of Exmoor, I should record our announcemitt some weeks ago that we were assisting the National Park Authority to buy 880 acres of land at Larkbarrow, on Exmoor. The intention is to ensure the retention in perpetuity of this area in the heart of one of the most extensive areas of remaining moorland, which Lord Porchester regarded as essential to the char-acted of Exmoor. That will be a valuable step forward. I say that we are assisting the National Park Authority to buy this land because our role is essentially a bridging role. Once we have acquired the land it will be resold to the National Park Authority and leased back to the present owner, with suitable arrangements to ensure that while the moorland is retained and the public given unrestricted access for the first time this century, there will be continuing use of the land for agriculture. We have backed up our good intentions by action. A number of hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway, spoke about forestry. No debate concerned with tourism and the environment would be complete without a reference to forestry and its place in the countryside. In the past, foresters were encouraged to maximise planting. This was done in a way that did not always sit easily in the landscape. Attitudes have changed over the past two decades, and foresters are now very conscious of the visual impact that new planting can have, and of the need to ensure that it is done in a way which will enhance rather than detract from the beauty of our countryside. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West raised several important points, in particular about elm disease. That was a tragedy that probably could not have been avoided. The Countryside Commission has done its best, through a planting scheme, to see that as many as possible of the elms are replaced by other deciduous trees. That activity has been restricted only by lack of resources. Con- siderable care is taken, through consultation with planning authorities and the agriculture Departments, to ensure that afforestation proposals are compatible with the natural environment as well as with agricultural and other land uses. The Forestry Commission retains the services of an independent landscape architect as its consultant and also employs a small team of landscape architects. It promotes the principles of good design throughout the forestry service, and in assessing grant-aid proposals from private woodland owners, to ensure that care for the landscape is a normal part of forestry practice. Forestry can make a significant contribution to tourism and public recreation. That has been highlighted by hon. Members. Forests provide unique opportunities for peace and tranquility and can absorb people in a way that open land cannot. They also afford opportunities for nature study, walking, camping and picnicking, as well as for more strenuous pursuits such as riding and orienteering. My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and I were present at the orienteering competition last weekend, in South-West Scotland. We were greatly impressed by the organisation of the event. Many tourists had come to watch, and there were 3,000 competitors, together with their friends and relatives. This made a tremendous impact in a rural area, and no doubt substantially helped the local economy. Private woodland owners and the Forestry Commission work together to provide the opportunity for this very healthy and desirable sport. My hon. Friend will agree with me, I am sure, when I say that we are luckier than many hon. Members because of the forward-looking attitudes of Conservatives in the South-West of Scotland, who have encouraged all forms of recreation -walking, sport, and so on. The facilities in that fine part of the world are freely available to the people of this land and to the tourists to enjoy as much as possible. I commend their efforts, and those of the Forestry Commission, to the House. The latest figure available to me shows that about 24 million visits were made to Forestry Commission forests during 1977. Before leaving forestry, I should like to mention the visit that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and I made to South House Moor, in Yorkshire, last month. This is an area of outstanding beauty which many feared was liable to be planted in the near future. The fact that my hon. Friend and I went there together indicates the great co-operation and co-ordination which exists between the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment. We wanted to make a decision ourselves on whether it was a suitable site for afforestation. After looking at it we decided that it was not, and that a grant would not be made available for planting this area. That shows the strength of feeling within the Government on the question of conservation. The decision won wide approval from conservation societies and others who take such a close interest in any decision that is made affecting the countryside. Hon. Members have rightly raised the question of environmental pollution and agriculture-particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Devon, North and for Kingswood (Mr. Aspinwall). There has been an increasing tendency towards environmental pollution. We all know the problems involved in the use of fertilisers and sprays. There is no doubt that the country is well aware of these arguments and that they are being looked at very carefully indeed. We hope that conclusions will be reached that will enable us to look after this whole problem area. It is not one that is being pushed under the carpet and forgotten. It is recognised that it is of great importance. I was glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West gave me an opportunity to talk about recreation in the countryside, particularly relative to country pursuits, which include field sports, which he and others mentioned. Those landowners, farmers and others who look after the habitat for game also provide the right conditions for conservation -the small plantations, the coppices, the corners that can be fenced off and planted with shrubs and deciduous trees. There are also the ponds which they look after. This is ideal ground for breeding purposes for animals and birds of all kinds. I commend their great efforts in the interests of conservation in every possible way. It should be recognised that they are the same people who are likely to be careful with sprays in the countryside and with the application of fertiliser. They are likely to be careful about the hacking out of hedgerows and hedgerow timbers, which is so important to the nesting of birds and to the preservation of cover in the countryside for the life and development of mammals of all sorts. They are also the people who will keep down vermin, for very good reason. Obviously, we want to have an ecological balance in the countryside. Too much vermin will affect the habitat and the life of birds and mammals living therein. Again, they are the people who enjoy fishing and look after the river banks. They keep an eye on pollution; they report about it. It is right that fishermen should take these steps and indicate to those who are supposed to control pollution where it is taking place. They work in harmony with gamekeepers and with water bailiffs. In the world of sport, the whole countryside provides an immense amount of employment throughout the United Kingdom and is of great importance in terms of the rural economy. The work done by the many associations and societies interested in field sports generally does a tremendous amount for conservation and in the preservation of our countryside. It is right that this should be recorded. The Countryside Review Committee has produced four papers-three during the period of the previous Government and one under this Government-all of which were of immense interest to those concerned with the countryside. But the last paper, No. 4-which was of as high a standard as the rest-included a suggestion that the designation of national parks and areas of outstanding national beauty might be looked at in a fresh light. That was the thinking of the committee, comprised of highly distinguished civil and public servants. It was very right that they should pose questions such as this for Ministers and Members of Parliament to think about. But I stress that at this stage these are only their thoughts. It is a valuable paper, but I should not like anyone to think that at this stage it represents Government or ministerial thinking."];;positive

1996-01-30a.779.1.txt;;['I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the law of trespass and to enable members of the public to resort on foot to open country in England and Wales for their recreation; and for connected purposes. The Bill\'s principal aim is to amend the law of trespass to enable members of the public to resort on foot to open country in England and Wales for their recreation. There is a long parliamentary history of such legislation. The reforming Liberal Member of Parliament, James Bryce, introduced the first access Bill in 1884. Unfortunately, that Bill and many successors have been blocked or emasculated by landowning interests in Parliament. Despite that fact, the demand and need to protect and extend the freedom of the public to wander on foot over uncultivated land is greater than ever. Walking is today\'s most popular leisure activity. This is a time of pressure and stress. People need space in which to walk, unwind and reflect. The Bill will benefit walkers throughout England and Wales, from the chalk downlands of Sussex to the Cheviot hills of Northumberland, from the Cumbrian mountains in Wales to the Sussex coastline. In the forest of Bowland in Lancashire, the Arran hills of Wales, parts of the Pennines and the Chiltern escarpment, local people have been pressing for many years for a right to roam over uncultivated land. There and in other parts of the country, there has been a tradition of open access-a de facto right to roam. Those rights have gradually been eroded. The piecemeal disposal of Forestry Commission woodland has meant that in recent years the public have lost the right to roam over an area about the size of the Isle of Wight. Some months ago, my family and I were asked to leave woodland called Cotgrave forest in Nottinghamshire. Those woods have been walked by local people for years. The sale of the woods by the Forestry Commission to landowners has put an end to that access. The Bill will tackle that. Against that background, it is important to stake out the rights and responsibilities of both walkers and landowners. The Bill gives a right to roam in the remote places-mountain and moorland, commonland, woodland and beside rivers. It is not an unrestricted right to roam. Exclusions are to be granted to take into account shooting and conservation interests. I fully recognise that there are a wide variety of stakeholders in the countryside. The Bill attempts to balance those needs. Rights and responsibilities are linked under the Bill. It sets out responsibilities and a new standard of behaviour for the public while walking on open country. The first schedule describes in detail the prescriptions and restrictions put on walkers. It includes, for example, control of animals, litter and fires. Walkers will be regarded as trespassers if they break the restrictions. The Bill is not set in tablets of stone. I see it as a vehicle for debate about the way forward, as it is a subject that can be riddled with prejudice. These are hard issues, which need careful thought and analysis. Consultation on the Bill will be wide and has, indeed, already started. Conservation groups have an interest in the Bill. Walkers, like conservationists, want to lift the landscape and enhance the environment. We need to protect animal, bird and plant life. I am grateful for the time and interest that landowning organisations have already given to the Bill. Meetings have taken place with the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union. While there is a commonality of interest and both organisations accept that there is a need for even greater access to the countryside, there are differences of view about how that should be achieved. I understand that the Country Landowners Association will produce its proposals on access later this year. I look forward to seeing them and I know that they will receive careful consideration and close scrutiny. Suffice it to say that negotiated access-the voluntary approach-has failed to deliver substantial new access. I am pleased to report that both farmers and landowners have shown a willingness to take such discussions forward. They have reservations about the Bill and I acknowledge that it may be possible to refine and improve it. At this stage, the Bill should be regarded as the first step on a route to allow greater public access to open countryside. I hope that when it crosses its first stile today, it will be viewed as offering a signpost to the future. I look forward to the day, perhaps under a different Government, when the Bill will become law. I believe that it is practical, reasonable and follows English legal precedent. It is practical in the sense that it provides draft legislation, which can be implemented on the ground. It is reasonable in that is not a utopian demand for everything that the access lobby would wish for in an ideal world. Opponents of the Bill should accept it at face value and in good faith. To characterise it, as some have, as allowing unrestricted access reveals prejudice and vested interest. It is an attempt to address all countryside interests without causing substantial harm to any. It is a balancing act. Consultation will reveal whether that balance is right. The Bill offers nothing alien. There is already a long-standing tradition of freedom to roam in Britain. Unfortunately, in many places it is under threat or has already disappeared. The Bill follows legal precedent. I praise the Ramblers Association and its legal advisers for all the hard work that they have put into drafting it. Wherever possible, it draws on existing legislation, principally the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. I am conscious that I have concentrated on the restrictions and exemptions in the Bill. That reflects my desire to reassure the many differing interests involved. However, in essence the Bill is about lifting restrictions. Its principle is freedom. It offers the prospect of substantial new access to the general public. I was born in an industrial community in the West Riding, a place where "dark satanic mills" really existed. I can still recall the joy and exhilaration of walking, as a boy, over the tops of the Yorkshire dales. I truly felt that I had discovered England\'s "green and pleasant land" and, to a small extent, I felt that I shared Blake\'s vision. Thirty years ago I was ordered off the moors in Yorkshire by gamekeepers even though I was on a public footpath. Yesterday I was in the hills and snow in the south Pennines between Sheffield and Manchester. There was barely a building in sight, but we were not allowed to walk on open moorland. Large signs that said "Keep out" and "No public access" made progress impossible. I want those signs confined to the dustbin of history. They should be museum pieces. People are looking forward to the year 2000 and the next millennium-a time of renewal, of hope and, perhaps, of increased spirituality. The Access to the Countryside Bill draws on the old, traditional rights to roam and puts them into a new legislative framework. Its passage would indeed be the way to celebrate the next millennium.'];;negative
1999-07-21a.1135.2.txt;;['I shall preface my remarks by congratulating those hon. Members who have taken the opportunity of this Adjournment debate to highlight the problems of the sheep and pig industries. Before I move on to my own theme, however, I wish to state how much I deplore the comments of my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Bradley). The House will understand that what the hon. Gentleman said was covered by parliamentary privilege, but I did not hear him cite any specific charges that had been brought against Mr. Ashcroft. I remind the House of the very important principle and tenet in British law that a man is innocent until proved otherwise. The hon. Gentleman questioned the motives and motivation of Mr. Ashcroft, but I hope that I shall not be out of order in questioning the hon. Gentleman\'s motives. He spent 10 minutes giving us a lot of innuendo but, as far as I know, he was unable to substantiate that with any facts. On a more pleasant note, I wish to say that, in my opinion, the British countryside looks more beautiful than it has ever done at this time of year, probably due to the wet spring that we had. I know that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, have an interest in trees, and you will appreciate that the beauty of the British countryside is largely due to the tree cover that it enjoys. I want to speak specifically about commercial forestry. Last year, the Government issued their forestry strategy for England, which was largely aspirational and entirely platitudinous. As far as commercial forestry was concerned, it was eminently worthy but, in practical terms, worthless. England, together with Ulster and Eire, is bottom of the European league for tree coverage. In England, 8 per cent, of the land mass is covered in trees. In Eire the figure is 7 per cent., and in Ulster 6 per cent. In contrast, the overall figure for European Union land mass coverage is 36 per cent. Taking the United Kingdom as a whole, the comparable figure is 10 per cent., but that includes large areas of scrub oak, the third most common species after spruce and pine. I have some questions for the Government. Are they satisfied with the present situation and the current downward trend in new planting? What, if anything, are they prepared to do about the matter, and how will they go about it? At present, the forestry industry is experiencing unprecedented difficulties. First, it suffers from red tape, particularly that associated with felling controls. Secondly, it suffers from cheap imports-I remind the House that labour costs in Latvia, for example, are a quarter of those in the United Kingdom. Moreover, road fuel prices in Latvia are only a third of those in this country. Thirdly, crippling vehicle excise and road fuel duties have a much more significant effect on forestry than on industries whose loads are less bulky and often much more valuable. Haulage accounts for at least 25 per cent, of the delivered value of British-grown round timber. For obvious reasons, the scope for transferring the loads to the railways is limited. A lot of our forestry land is well removed from the rail-heads, and in any case loads have to be hauled by road to reach them. A fourth problem facing the industry is the lack of any coherent long-term Government strategy sufficient to give the private sector long-term confidence. Forestry is, after all, a very long-term business. People who plant trees often do not live to see them come to maturity. Planting, therefore, is done with the long term in view. Fifthly, the Forestry Commission is a rogue elephant when it comes to commercial decisions, and does not always operate under the same constraints as the private sector. Many other difficulties face the industry, not least an ill-informed public who do not accept that trees are grown as a commercial crop and that trees, like humans, have a finite life. A prosperous commercial forestry industry brings many economic benefits. First, there is an obvious benefit in the employment that it creates. The forestry industry is a major employer in rural areas. It is estimated that it employs 35,000 people in the United Kingdom, and that employment is permanent and year-round. That contrasts with the agriculture industry, where more of the labour tends to be under contract and on a seasonal basis. Moreover, the forestry industry is often situated in remote areas where there is no alternative employment. In the past decade, the industry has invested no less than GBP 1.8 billion in new saw milling and wood processing facilities, which now produce timber and wood products derived from British forests that are worth GBP 2 billion per annum. That is a valuable contribution to our balance of payments. Our forests represent a store of value and are a very important strategic reserve. The third benefit to be derived from a healthy forestry industry is to the environment. I have already mentioned how trees benefit the landscape, and most hon. Members will be aware of the beneficial effect that trees have on our atmosphere by absorbing surplus nitrogen and other impurities. Forestry is a sustainable and infinitely renewable source of raw material and fuel. Given that so many people are worried about the environment, a thriving forestry industry will ensure that there is life and work in our countryside, and will prevent its reduction into a decaying park. I have several questions that the Government must answer. Do they acknowledge the economic, environmental and employment benefits of a thriving forestry industry? Do they accept that the portents for the future are alarming? The area approved for felling increased from 12,000 hectares in 1989 to 19,000 hectares in 1998, but the area planted in the same period fell from 37,000 hectares to 17,000 hectares. What action will the Government take to deal with the problems that I have described? They could remove at a stroke the burden of regulation and the punitive effect of the exorbitant 11.6 per cent, increase in road fuel duties. Will the Government look again at the efficacy of their grant schemes in encouraging a vibrant forestry industry, and will they consider reintroducing tax reliefs such as existed before 1988? Now that the "polluter pays" principle is so well established, there is a strong case for giving relief to those who, far from polluting the atmosphere, do so much to clean it up. Or will the Government do nothing? Will they take the short-term view that foresters are an insignificant minority; that 35,000 jobs are neither here nor there; that our timber can all be sourced from abroad; that a living vibrant countryside is the rhetoric, not the reality, of Labour in office? I move that the House does not adjourn until a Minister has come to the Dispatch Box to state unequivocally that wood is good, and what the Government will do positively to encourage this generation to plant trees for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.'];;negative
2006-02-16b.1668.0.txt;;['I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) on securing this debate and thus raising issues about the regional and national work that is taking forward the sustainable communities agenda. My honourable colleague has been involved in the development of the RSPB\'s Old Moor wetlands centre since its inception and I commend him and Councillor Norbury on the leadership they have shown in supporting that important and valuable community asset. My hon. Friend was deputy leader and leader of the local council, as well as now being the very active local Member of Parliament.The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is all about creating sustainable communities, and our departmental strapline and mission statement reflect that fact. However, that is much more than about words: it is about creating change, delivering diversity and implementing initiatives. That commitment comes not just from the ODPM, but from across Government. We are working closely with the Department of Trade and Industry, through the regional development agencies, with the DEFRA agents, such as the Environment Agency, and with organisations such as the RSPB to create better places to live and work, such as those in Barnsley described by my hon. Friend.But I should like us to take a step back: the sustainable communities plan, launched in 2003, set out the Government\'s long-term vision for thriving, sustainable communities in every English region. The plan defined an ambitious programme to deliver a step change in housing supply, decent homes, urban renewal and countryside protection, and it also signalled unprecedented investment in our neighbourhood environments. It also made a commitment to the environment, making it clear that it is important that new housing should be located on brownfield land where possible and that the protection of the countryside and the green belt were priorities for the Government.We have seen achievements in those areas. Residential development on brownfield land is up from 56 per cent. in 1997 to 72 per cent. today. The density of new residential developments has increased from 25 dwellings per hectare in 1997 to 40 per hectare. Between 1997 and 2004, there was a net increase of about 26,000 hectares in designated green belt. A further 13,000 hectares of green belt has been proposed in emerging development plans.The sustainable communities plan also set ambitious targets for the growth areas, including the Thames Gateway, to consider green space as part of the overall master plan. In the Thames Gateway, the "Greening the Gateway" strategy established the principle that new and existing residential and commercial areas should be set in a network of varied and well managed green space. Supported by GBP 26 million from the ODPM Thames Gateway programme fund, a number of green space initiatives have been funded, including GBP 3.25 million to ensure the protection of the RSPB reserve at Rainham marshes and to construct an environment and education centre; GBP 5 million for the London Riverside conservation park at Rainham and Averley marshes and the restoration of Erith, Crayford and Dartford marshes; and GBP 2 million to provide a 74 hectare conservation site at Nevenden nature reserve in Basildon.ODPM funding worth GBP 40 million is supporting the delivery of key components of green infrastructure in the key growth locations by improving the interface between the urban and rural environments, providing improved access for people and wildlife and restoring areas of the countryside, which provides people with more opportunities to experience and interact with their environment first hand, as suggested by my hon. Friend.Two examples of projects being funded are Dunstable downs, which is receiving GBP 1.5 million to provide a new flagship facility to accommodate additional visitors resulting from the nearby growth area, and the Forest of Marston Vale, which is working to transform 61 square miles of land in a key location between Bedford and Milton Keynes, with a long-term aim of achieving 30 per cent. woodland cover. A sum of GBP 2.8 million will ensure a wide range of environment and community benefits, including landscape improvement, wildlife conservation, agricultural diversification, recreation provision, employment generation and environmental education.More recently, the Government\'s response to Kate Barker\'s review of housing supply reinforced the commitment to protecting and enhancing the environment alongside accommodating housing growth. As my hon. Friend can see, on a national and regional level we are working cross-departmentally to deliver sustainable communities.Quite a few of the examples I have cited are from the south and the midlands, but let us not forget the subject of today\'s debate. My hon. Friend has given us the example of the Old Moor wetlands centre in a former coalfield area in his constituency, and I am glad that he has raised the profile of the centre, which demonstrates what can be achieved in a location that could so easily have become a no man\'s land, or a nobody\'s land, to be more politically correct.Reflecting on what I said earlier, Old Moor certainly demonstrates excellent usage of brownfield land being, as it is, a former farmhouse and associated agricultural buildings surrounded by an area formerly used for mining with some contaminated land. Through a combined budget of GBP 500 million, the national coalfields programme, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust and the Coalfields Enterprise Fund mentioned by my hon. Friend are delivering real change through a long-term programme and commitment to action. People are being given access to the skills and jobs that they need, the environmental legacy of the coal industry is being cleaned up, and the housing, economic and social needs of the local communities are being addressed.Old Moor nature reserve is a practical example of how a former coalfield site can become an important community asset. A number of the awards received by the centre mirror the Government\'s commitment to sustainable building. During the actual building process, the builders, Wakefield-based Tolent Construction, demonstrated high standards of workmanship and health and safety to staff and visitors. The company and the RSPB won the national built-in quality award for innovation for the visitor centre\'s many energy conservation measures. It has a wind turbine, solar panels and wood chip boiler supplied from a nearby sawmill.There are also links to education, culture and heritage through the work of the centre. Old Moor, with its extensive visitor facilities, is a fantastic place to watch wildlife, particularly a range of birds. A mix of habitats includes open water, marsh, reed beds and grassland. There are also curriculum-linked, term-time educational visits, including pond-dipping, "mini-beasting" and other creative and science-based activities to suit children from reception to key stage 2. Around 4,000 children have had first-hand experience of nature through the reserve\'s field teaching programme, and 65,000 visitors are expected to go through the gates during this financial year, reaching the targets set for 2008. I am sure that, as a result of this enjoyable but educational facility, a generation of children will grow up with a much wider appreciation of the local environment, and that that enjoyment will translate in later life into a caring and responsible attitude towards their community, as my hon. Friend suggested.As my hon. Friend said, by the first anniversary of the opening of the centre in the autumn, the RSPB work should be replicated across the country in line with the Government\'s sustainable communities agenda. I hope that I have demonstrated that this is happening nationally, and I certainly commend the RSPB\'s plans to create and enhance other wildlife areas throughout the Dearne valley. The RSPB has additional proposals for the Yorkshire coalfield area to develop more reserves. In the Lower Aire valley, it is looking at opportunities between Leeds and Castleford. It is to work alongside UK Coal Mining Ltd at the former open-cast St. Aidan site. People living, working and visiting the area will have easy access to a network of sites via new footpaths, bridleways and cycle routes.Moving slightly further afield from South Yorkshire but still in the Yorkshire and Humber region, North Yorkshire county council is consulting on the Swale and Ure washland project. Future sites could form a network, with high ecological, landscape and amenity value. In Wakefield, the council is working with partners through developing local area agreements to develop plans to designate a number of local nature reserves, to improve biodiversity and provide improved green spaces for the deprived communities in its district.I cannot finish without referring to the work of the Land Restoration Trust. It is a joint venture company, which was launched in 2004 by the Deputy Prime Minister. It is jointly owned by English Partnerships, Groundwork, the Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission, and regional development agencies are represented on its board. It seeks to hold sites, including many in the former coalfields, and to ensure that they are managed into perpetuity.I certainly feel that I have covered a lot of ground, both geographically and from a policy point of view. It is easy to get drawn into the minutiae of these issues, so it is good to reflect on the bigger picture, as afforded by my hon. Friend. He has raised the issue of sustainable communities with reference to the Old Moor wetlands centre. Communities are about people-people from all backgrounds, young and old. Centres such as Old Moor help to bring life to an area in many ways. That area suffered with the decline of the mining industry, but a new life is emerging, as demonstrated at Old Moor and replicated in other parts of the country. I conclude by congratulating my hon. Friend once again, not only on securing this debate, but on his solid support for our policies generally and for the Old Moor wetlands site and the creation of similar sites across the country, ensuring the building of sustainable communities.Question put and agreed to.Adjourned accordingly at twenty-eight minutes past Six o\'clock.'];;neutral
2009-12-07c.94.6.txt;;["Before those somewhat churlish closing remarks, I was going to say what a great pleasure it was to follow the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed), who speaks with great knowledge of the nuclear industry.As many other Members have pointed out, it is not wholly coincidental that we are debating the Second Reading of the Bill on the first day of the Copenhagen summit on climate change, which has been described by some as the most important conference in human history. Although there may be some hyperbole in that description-I seem to recall that Yalta was quite important-the question of climate change is certainly the dominant one for our generation. Notwithstanding the local difficulties at the university of East Anglia's climatic research unit, it is clear to most sensible commentators that the world's climate is indeed changing. Whether climate change is caused by human activity is still a matter for debate.A few years ago I was fortunate enough to pay a visit to the Argonne national laboratory in Chicago. My visit and the presentation that I received there left me in no doubt whatever that since mass industrialisation, the world's climate has warmed and is continuing to warm significantly. I, for one, am entirely satisfied that human activity is contributing significantly to global warming, and it is clear that for the sake of future generations, we must take what action we can to attempt to slow that process and to adapt to it.As other hon. Members have pointed out, however, the Government have been somewhat slow to respond to this phenomenon. Given that some 47 per cent. of carbon emissions are produced in energy generation, the Government's energy policy was for many years timid, with a refusal, for example, to accept and recognise the urgent need to replace our ageing fleet of nuclear power stations. Very late in the day they have recognised that nuclear generation should be an important part of the energy mix of this country, and that it will be necessary to build new nuclear reactors.The Government's slowness in recognising that fact means that there will be a hiatus of many years between the closure of our last remaining nuclear stations and the commissioning of the new ones. During that time the country will be prone to serious power cuts, and when the lights go off, the British people will remember who is responsible for that.Nevertheless, there are signs in the Bill that the Government have belatedly recognised that security of supply should be central to our energy policy. To that extent, I welcome the amendments in clauses 16 and 17, which provide that the principal objective of both the Secretary of State and Ofgem is to protect the interests of consumers in relation to gas and electricity-interests which include the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, and security of supply. Indeed, security of supply must be a prime objective.With the depletion of North sea oil and gas and the decline in our nuclear generating capability, it is all the more important to ensure that our supply of gas and electricity is as secure as it may be. This will undoubtedly mean employing various fuels for the generation of electricity, including nuclear, gas, conventional fossil fuels and renewables.We in Wales have a significant interest in all matters relating to energy, which is perhaps unsurprising, given that we are sitting on large coal reserves, are in a particularly windy part of the country, and have coastlines that lend themselves to the production of tidal power, to say nothing of the fact that we are on the coast of the Severn estuary. We also have one of the last remaining operational nuclear power stations, at Wylfa, and I was pleased to see that only last month the Secretary of State indicated that Wylfa was a preferred location for one of the new fleet of nuclear power stations.We also have Trawsfyndd, which is in the process of decommissioning, and which I have visited. It provides an example of an impressive exercise in the handling of a retired nuclear power station. I was told by the work force there that one of the things they would like most of all in that area is another nuclear power station, because nuclear power stations provide high-value jobs in areas where frequently there is no other work at all.We also have the Dinorwig and Ffestiniog pump storage schemes. I am sure many hon. Members have visited those schemes. They are remarkable feats of engineering, able to fire up from complete shutdown in 12 seconds, giving an enormous and reliable boost to the energy supply in the grid.Some three years ago, the Welsh Affairs Committee conducted an important inquiry into energy in Wales, and produced a follow-up report a couple of years later. Those reports were important contributions to the debate on energy production in this country, and I commend both of them to hon. Members. Some of the themes touched on by the Committee in its inquiry have to some extent been addressed by the Government and feature in the Bill. In particular, I welcome the proposals to take forward the development of carbon capture and storage technology, as set out in part 1.Coal is an important resource for future generation in the UK. However, it is clear that if we accept, as I believe we must, that emissions from conventional power stations are contributing significantly to global warming, the problem of those emissions must be addressed.The Select Committee on Science and Technology has indicated that in the long term, some 85 per cent. of carbon dioxide emissions could be stored safely through the development of carbon capture and storage technology, so it is highly desirable to do as much as we can to develop that. We are fortunate in this country in that we already have significant expertise in exploiting the North sea's resources, which themselves could be turned to the development of CCS technology. Exhausted wells in the North sea could also prove to be ideal locations for the storage of captured carbon. The Government therefore need to press on with the development of CCS technology, and I welcome the Bill to the extent that, in its own faltering way, it provides the launch pad for that development.However, I have concerns about how CCS will be funded. My constituency-indeed, much of Wales-is largely rural, and I know from conversations with constituents that fuel poverty is a significant concern. Indeed, it has been estimated that more than 740,000 rural households in the UK live in fuel poverty, and that amounts to about 8 per cent. of rural households. Further, some 42 per cent. of rural households are not connected to the gas mains, as compared with only 8 per cent. of households in urban areas. As a consequence, many rural households rely upon liquified petroleum gas or fuel oil to heat their homes, and the Commission for Rural Communities has estimated that heating a three-bedroom house in the countryside costs some GBP 1,300 per annum using LPG and GBP 1,044 using domestic fuel oil, as against only GBP 568 using mains gas.Clause 4 provides that CCS demonstration projects will be funded by a levy on electricity suppliers. As other hon. Members have said, that levy will undoubtedly be passed on to consumers in the form of higher electricity prices, and although the levy will affect all consumers, it will have a disproportionate affect on rural households, which already pay considerably more than urban households to heat their homes. Clause 4(4) provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations exempting certain types of electricity suppliers from the levy, so I ask the Secretary of State to consider the disproportionate impact that electricity price increases will have on rural consumers, particularly because they will not benefit from the schemes in part 2 for reducing fuel poverty, because those do not apply to either LPG or fuel oil.Returning to clause 17, I should say that the new statutory focus on greenhouse gas emissions will, or should, clearly lead to the development of new sources of renewable energy. At the moment, the principal form of renewable energy in Wales, as indeed in most of the rest of the country, is wind power. There is no doubt that wind should form part of an energy mix, but it is illusory to suggest that it can ever constitute a reliable form of base load generation. Its efficiency-at some 27 per cent. as opposed to nuclear power's 95 per cent.-is worryingly low, and the reasons why are obvious: wind by its nature is intermittent, and when the wind does not blow the turbines do not turn.Wind can at best, therefore, constitute only an ancillary source of generation. However, in Wales and many other parts of the country, wind appears to be the only form of renewable generation that is being pursued, and the inherent hazardousness of that is self-evident. During the five coldest days last winter, very few turbines turned, and those days were just the period when we needed as much electricity as possible. The reason why they did not turn is quite simple: a large anticyclone was sitting over the British Isles, and as every schoolboy knows, anticyclones in winter tend to produce cold conditions without wind.Nevertheless, wind farms continue to be built, and that is a significant phenomenon in Wales, where the Welsh Assembly Government's infamous technical advice note 8 provides a planning presumption in favour of wind farm development in the so-called strategic search areas, which tend to be located, interestingly enough, on Forestry Commission land, the rental income of which passes to the Welsh Assembly Government. Consequently, large areas of Welsh upland are being progressively colonised by wind turbines.Indeed, the Hiraethog area of my constituency contains numerous small wind farms that have been consented to under town and country planning legislation. RWE npower renewables, however, now has plans to build in the Clocaenog forest a wind farm with an output of more than 50 MW, for which an application will soon be made to the Department of Energy and Climate Change under the provisions of the Electricity Act 1989. If that is consented to, the cumulative impact of development on the Hiraethog area will be to turn a beautiful rural landscape into an industrialised one-for a source of generation that is only 27 per cent. efficient.Part of the problem is the way in which renewables obligation certificates are structured, a point that the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) touched on briefly. ROCs are a very blunt instrument that reward the developers of wind farms at precisely the same rate as the developers of other renewable technologies-with one certificate per megawatt-hour. The Department has proposals for banding ROCs to encourage the development of other forms of renewable technology. However, wind farms would still have the benefit of one ROC per megawatt-hour under the Government's new proposals. That is particularly worrying, because other forms of renewable technology, if exploited, could prove significantly more efficient than wind.In that respect, I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. He mentioned tidal power, which offers the most obvious advantages. The tide, after all, ebbs and flows with absolute predictability twice a day, every day, and Wales has many locations where tidal stream technology and tidal lagoon technology could be developed commercially. Swansea bay and Kinmel bay, which is off the coast of my constituency, offer particularly exciting potential for the development of tidal lagoons.Indeed, evidence taken by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs indicated that the Kinmel bay site had a potential generating capacity of 432 MW, which is by any standards a significant power station. However, ROCs have hitherto not differentiated between the various forms of renewable technology, so developers have tended to opt for the low-hanging fruit of wind turbines, with all their inherent unreliability, as opposed to tide. The Department's proposed re-banding will not settle that.Wind turbines are relatively cheap and easy to construct, so developers will continue to opt for them, but the Government should reconsider their proposal for the banding of renewables obligation certificates as a matter of some urgency, so as positively to encourage the development of new technologies.As other Members have said, this Bill is a step in the right direction, but it is a somewhat timid and faltering one. The Government need to be bolder and to act more quickly and decisively. Twelve years have elapsed, and only now are we really getting to grips with a problem that will affect our children very significantly indeed. We need to develop the nuclear power stations and to facilitate development of the reliable renewable technologies that the country needs. I believe that this will be done, but that the Government who achieve it will be a Conservative one."];;negative
1932-06-03a.1485.1.txt;;['The new Clause only appeared on the Order Paper to-day for the first time and there has been little opportunity to study it and no possibility of consulting the Forestry Commission about it. My right hon. Friend, however, approached the chairman of the Forestry Commission yesterday, who got into touch with me, and I am authorised by the chairman of the Forestry Commission to state that he considers the Clause a sound one. For what my poor opinion may be worth, I confirm that view, and I have no doubt that it will be approved by our colleagues, the remaining Forestry Commissioners. From the point of view of the private owner of woodlands, and it may be the corporate owners of woodlands, I also think it is satisfactory. It is inevitable in these matters that at times there may be a division of opinion between possibly the less informed persons who would regret the removal of picturesque old trees, such as we all love to see about the countryside, and those who take the longer view and realise that, to maintain permanently the beauty of a woodland, when old trees reach or pass a certain age they must be removed and their place taken by others. It is a very poor policy in forestry or landscape, where you have to think of all time, to leave the wreck of a fine tree, because it retains some elements of the picturesque, until it falls to pieces and there is nothing to take its place. I think the Clause is as sound an attempt as we can expect to be devised to reconcile the different views of those who are equally desirous of maintaining the beauty of the countryside. I welcome the Clause and hope the House will accept it.'];;positive
1937-12-08a.477.7.txt;;['I beg to move, That this House, recognising the importance of the preservation of amenities, wishes to call attention to the desirability of strengthening the Advertisements Regulation Acts and to the anxiety that exists with respect to the activities of the Forestry Commission in the Lake District and other areas of great natural beauty. In moving this Motion I should like to say quite clearly that it is a double-barrelled Motion. It deals with two distinct subjects, and I suggest that, if both of these subjects are to be dealt with as they should be, it would be desirable that hon. Members should restrict the length of their speeches to somewhat narrow limits. I shall try to do that myself, and I would ask hon. Members to speak as shortly as possible, in order that, in particular, the Forestry Commission may have a fair run in the course of the Debate. I need hardly remind hon. Members that the Forestry Commission never seems to have a chance of explaining its work to the House. I make no apology for introducing the general subject of amenities. It is an exceedingly important subject. On the other hand, it would be ridiculous to say that it is as urgent or as immediately important to the people in general as the questions of food, housing, health or employment. Of course, it is not. But, when one considers that the word "amenity" is given in the dictionary as meaning pleasantness, and when one remembers that the movement in favour of the preservation of amenities is a movement in favour of preserving the pleasant side of life, of preserving the country background of what is predominantly an urban population, I hope no one will feel that I am wasting the time of the House in calling attention to two comparatively restricted and definite points relating to the preservation of amenities. Some apology to hon. Members for the very limited scope of my Motion is, however, necessary. The limitation is due to the fact that I hold an exceedingly humble honorary post in the Ministry of Health, being Parliamentary Private Secretary to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. That means, of course, that I cannot raise any questions which are dealt with by the Department with which I am connected. I should, of course, have liked to raise the general question of our policy towards amenities, but that would be out of order, and I will content myself with leaving this thought with hon. Members; Amenities are dealt with by almost every Government Department-by the Ministry of Health, the Home Office, the Office of Works, the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Fine Arts Commission, and, finally on occasion even the Defence Departments have to decide questions of amenities. I would ask the House whether the time has not come when we should have a co-ordinated policy for dealing with amenities and a co ordinating body to work out that policy. I wish to leave that thought with hon. Members and pass on to the actual Motion. My short experience of politics has taught me that, if one wants to get anything done in this House, it is better to concentrate on definite points, rather than to range vaguely over a wide field, and from that point of view it is possible that the limited scope of my Motion may prove to be a blessing in disguise. I have said that it is a double-barrelled Motion, and I propose to fire the first barrel at my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. It is fired more in love than in enmity, and I hope my hon. Friend will reciprocate. The problem is that of the regulation of advertisements. I think it is generally agreed that it is a problem. Anybody can see that by going for a walk or a drive throughout the country. On the other hand, it is a problem which it is very easy to get hysterical over and to exaggerate. I do not for a moment say that every comer of the country is ruined by unsightly advertisements. I am very anxious to deal with this problem with moderation, and not to be guilty of over statement. Nor am I at all anxious to be thought to have a quarrel with the big advertisers. I have not. I think that, like the majority of people, they are reasonable, and that they have an affection and regard and consideration for the amenities of the countryside. The only difference between us is one of method. I am not against advertisements in their proper place; in fact, I like a good row of gaily coloured posters. They add colour to a drab civilisation; they constitute the poor man\'s picture gallery; and I am certain that our life would be much the poorer without the large hoardings. Apart from that, they perform a valuable service to trade and industry, and to every individual, down to the humblest housewife, who buys her necessities according to their recommendations. This subject can only be settled by agreement and willingness to meet the other side, on the part of both parties. I claim that what I am suggesting would be helpful to the public-spirited advertiser who does not put up an advertisement in a good site if he thinks it will spoil the amenities and then sometimes somebody else comes along and puts up an advertisement on the same site, with the result that both the amenities and the good advertiser suffer. There are two Acts which deal with this question-the Acts of 1907 and 1927. They were not contentious Measures. So far as I can discover there were no Divisions on them in this House: in fact, on the Act of 1907, the House was nearly counted out. The law works through local authorities, that is, county councils, borough councils and urban districts with population of over 10,000, and the sole method of procedure is by by-law. A standard type of by-law has been drawn up by the Home Office for regulating, restricting, or preventing the exhibition of advertisements so as to disfigure or injuriously affect (a) the natural beauty of the landscape or the view of rural scenery from a highway, railway, or public place;(b) the amenities of a village in a Rural District;(c) the amenities of public parks or pleasure promenades or of historic or public buildings or of places frequented by the public for their beauty or histiric interest." By-laws may also be made for: (d) the regulation and control of advertisement hoardings exceeding 12 feet in height. At first sight, these sound fine, comprehensive powers to confer on local authorities, but in actual practice they have been found inadequate, owing to the difficulty of securing proper enforcement and owing to the limitation placed on the scope of the by-laws. Consider how a county council-and all the county councils have made by laws-would enforce them when attention is drawn to what is considered an unsightly advertisement. They try to reach agreement with the advertiser. If he is not sufficiently enlightened to take down the advertisement, the council\'s only recourse is to prosecute him in a summary court. This means criminal proceedings. This is cumbersome, proof is difficult, and the delay is considerable. The local authority has no preventive power and no power to guard against a repetition of the offence on the same site by another advertiser, or by the same advertiser. This is the considered opinion of the county councils, which are asking for new powers and further legislation. In boroughs and urban districts, there is provision that the councils should make a definite schedule of the places they propose to protect when drawing up their by-laws. The effect has not been altogether good. Outside these scheduled areas, built-up areas are absolutely untouched by these Acts, except for hoardings over 12 feet in height, and advertisements not attached to hoardings, such as those on gable ends, are not dealt with at all. There is no power to protect residential or commercial areas, for example, the High Streets of country towns, than which nothing is more typically national or more beautiful-and no by-law ever devised can deal with the disfigurement of a whole street. I claim that the situation is fundamentally unsatisfactory for two reasons. I think permissive powers are always unsatisfactory. I regret that so much of our legislation is permissive. Secondly, when permissive powers are inadequate and difficult to enforce, the situation is doubly unsatisfactory. The hon. Member for Elland (Mr. Levy) has an Amendment on the Paper. I am sure he and his hon. Friends will make a great point of the fact that urban and district councils have only partially adopted the power given them to make by-laws. That proves to me quite as much that the by-law powers are unsatisfactory as that there is not sufficient keenness on the part of the councils. The fact is that the Association of Municipal Corporations has definitely requested new legislation, and they say that it is the actual procedure laid down and the powers given under these Acts which are unsatisfactory. It does not prove their lack of interest. Constantly, in private Bills, extensive powers are sought to deal with this problem of advertising, and resisted, perhaps rightly, by hon. Members, again proving that local authorities are not satisfied with the present state of the law. Various suggestions have been made for dealing with the question: for instance, the licensing of sites as suitable for advertisements. That would be a very drastic way of dealing with the situation. It would excite the strongest opposition from advertising interests, would lead to all sorts of complications among local authorities and in the towns themselves, and would certainly be highly contentious in this House. I am not prepared to advocate the licensing system without the fullest possible inquiry, which I have, of course, not been able to make. My present instinct is against it. My suggestion is in the nature of a compromise. I want to get away from the by-law procedure, and also to avoid the licensing system. I would give all local authorities statutory powers to require the removal of an offending advertisement, with, of course, the right of appeal to the courts on the part of the advertiser. That would include the right of the intended advertiser to go to the local authority in advance and apply for their approval for putting up an advertisement, also with the right of appeal. That would be an excellent solution, provided that the tribunal to which appeal may be made is the right one. There I find difficulty. I have come to the conclusion that the ordinary magistrates\' bench is the best, because advertising interests are convinced that the local bench will always go against them, and local authorities are convinced that it will always go against them. When they both regard it as profoundly unsatisfactory-although I admit the weakness of ray argument-I feel it is possible that that is the best tribunal. The new Bill which I would like to see would deal with advertising from the air-a terrible thing-and advertising from the sea. In certain seaside resorts, at nights, an illuminated vessel or barge is towed along, advertising various products with the most brilliant illuminated signs. There must be a limit to that. There is also the question of neon signs. What about the situation when advertisements along a highway are a definite distraction to drivers? That must be dealt with. I urge my hon. Friend who is going to reply for the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the idea of introducing legislation of this sort. There is one other point. Some believe that the Town and Country Planning Act is the best way to deal with this-the point is mentioned in the Amendment. I would only say this: It is generally agreed, by those best qualified to say, that there will be a tremendous amount of delay before advertising can be dealt with under that Act. A scheme has to be adopted as a whole or not at all. Advertisements cannot be dealt with separately. This is bound to mean delay. The question will have to be dealt with by fresh legislation or not at all. I realise that this matter is contentious. I appeal to the advertisers to make an effort to deal with it themselves. I should be only too anxious to meet them on every possible point if I were in the position of the Government, and I hope the Government will do the same. I urge my hon. Friend, when he replies, to say that the Government will introduce legislation of some sort next session. Finally, I would urge him to call a conference oh which the advertising interests, amenity societies, local authorities and the ordinary man-in-the-street will be represented. I leave it to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich (Mr. H. Strauss) to follow me on this subject. He is chairman of the Scapa Society. I wish to fire my other barrel in the direction of the Forestry Commission, and to call attention to the anxiety that exists. I am not saying that that anxiety is, or is not, justified, but I am calling attention to a state of affairs which is harmful to the Forestry Commissioners and to the peace of mind of many people in this country. I am not moving a vote of censure on the Forestry Commissioners. I wish to give them an opportunity of dispelling the anxiety which exists, and of saying something about their activities, because they never seem to get a chance of displaying their eloquence or extolling their achievements. I do not pose as an expert. I am an ordinary person, bred in the country, a lover of trees, even possessing a sort of complex for planting trees in every available spot. Of coarse I have only been able to make a cursory survey of the subject. But I have reached the conclusion that, within their limitations, partly inherent and partly self-imposed, the Commissioners have shown themselves increasingly conciliatory. I would go further and say that if you balance the successes and achievements of the Commissioners against their failures and shortcomings, I say without hesitation that they are entitled to the congratulations of this House. I say quite definitely, before I make any criticism, that, in fact, on the whole, by and large, the Commissioners are "a good thing within their limitations." Their limitations are very severe. Firstly, there is the limitation of their terms of reference in the Act of 1919 which set them up. The terms of reference imposed on them are purely economic. Section 3 does not say a word about preserving the beauties of the landscape or anything of that sort, and in another section directions are given for the composition of consultation committees. You have the representation of all the economic interests and of the purely afforestation interests, but there is no representation for the people who are interested in amenities. That is a very severe restriction. Then they are limited severely on the financial side. They are limited to the planting of conifers, as land which is suitable for hard woods is generally more expensive, and they are more or less buying up poor land that will only grow conifers. Then the Commission are not empowered by Parliament to look at any question from the broad point of view of national interest. They are bound by their terms of reference to the narrowest possible economic standpoint. Finally, in actual fact is has been found that there is little opportunity for parliamentary control and criticism. I do not think that question and answer are very useful in arriving anywhere at all, and I do not think that either of the Opposition parties are likely to call for the Forestry Vote on any Supply day when there is bigger game to be had. Then there are what I might call the self-imposed limitations of the Commissioners. I hope that the Commissioners will not think that I am criticising them unduly, but many people have the impression that the Commissioners think that the plantations of conifers are automatic additions to the beauties of the landscape. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for North Cornwall (Sir F. Acland)-I am sorry that he is not in his place-has a positive passion for conifers. The Commissioners do not appear fully to realise the strength of local feeling or the extent of local anxiety when plantations begin to spring up. Finally, they do not seem to realise that, on the amenity question, they are face to face with a very big problem indeed. It is not a question of a series of particular local problems that can be dealt with piecemeal by negotiation with local societies, or even with the Council for the Preservation of Rural England. Looked at in that way, problems and anxieties are bound to arise, and the Commissioners are bound to feel resentment whenever they feel that they are misunderstood, and that bad atmosphere, I regret to say, is sure to be created if these problems are looked at in a piece meal way. I take one example-yesterday\'s questions and answers. When my hon. and gallant Friend replied, I had the impression that he was a man full of good intentions, feeling that his good intentions were not understood, and suspecting every question as being either an attack or a leg-pull. I do not think that that is a satisfactory state of affairs. I do not think that the Commissioners are rightly understood by the public. I am sure that it is the fault of both sides, but, above all, of the Commissioners\' terms of reference. I will now take definite examples, beginning with the Lake District. I want to relieve the minds of hon. Members at once by stating that I am not going to quote Wordsworth, though I feel sorely tempted to do so. The best quotation I have found on the Lake District is that of Ruskin when he said: The hills are not wooded enough to be beautiful or high enough to be sublime. I think the reflection is upon Ruskin rather than upon the Lake District. After much anxiety and many negotiations and a great deal of trouble in all quarters, a solution of the Lake District problem has been arrived at, and the Forestry Commission have said that they will not try to acquire an area of about 300 square miles in the middle of the Lake District for planting purposes. I welcome that sincerely. It is a most satisfactory solution and reflects great credit upon the Forestry Commission. But it is not right-and I am not blaming anybody for this-that it should be looked at as a concession. Their terms of reference should prevent a question of that sort from cropping up in an area like the Lake District. I ask for one concession. I should like the Commissioners to do their best-I will not even say promise-not to buy any more of the shaded area in Eskdale and Duddondale. I found a sonnet by Wordsworth about the Duddon which I could quote with great effect but by my great self-denial I refrain from doing so. I appreciate very much what the Commission have already done on their land in that region and the way they have planted it, and especially the planting of beeches. I humbly congratulate the Commissioners on the way in which they intend to deal with Grisedale. It is not a very big area. They are planting the upper lands and moorlands and leaving the low meadow lands and the farms untouched. I take another case, that of the area around Thetford, in Norfolk, which is said to be the one part of the British Isles where the condition of the Russian Steppes are reproduced. I understand that a satisfactory solution has been arrived at there which will largely result in the creation of a great forest countryside, in which will be reserved broad natural open spaces whose value will be emphasised by the surrounding forest. Again, I congratu- late the Commissioners upon that solution, but I would point out that both these cases were treated separately and arrived at after separate negotiations with many local and central societies. I do not think that that is the way these things should be done. I speak as a former Northumberland Member, coming of Northumberland and Cumberland stock. The intentions of the Commissioners may be good or they may be bad in Northumberland, but the general public has no knowledge of them, and that is where the trouble is. As a result, anxiety is deep and widespread. Who knows the future of Redesdale and North Tyne? In both these cases the head waters have been planted already. Who knows the fate of the Wall? I feel exceedingly strongly on the question of the Roman Wall, where you have the most magnificent ancient monument in this country and the most magnificent countryside the world can show. A question was asked in this House yester day. My right hon. and gallant Friend gave an answer which disturbed me considerably. I want to know where we stand with regard to the Wall. I wish to call attention to his final reply which he thought was very satisfactory. He was asked whether the Commission judge for themselves the amenities of the Roman Wall and he replied: All such matters are considered by a Joint Committee of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England and of the Commissioners."-[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th December, 1937; col. 197, Vol. 330.] I will say later why I think that that is an unsatisfactory reply. In general, I ask the Commissioners what is to be the fate of the moors of Northumberland and Cumberland? Apart entirely from any personal point, we have to consider the public anxiety, and that anxiety is a bad thing in itself and should be set at rest, and I ask the Commissioners to do it. My suggestions are these. I want the Commission to realise that the problem cannot be dealt with by the Joint Council of the C.P.R.E., however adequate it may be. The question of time and business alone prevents that. We cannot expect great experts to give up enough of their time to a matter which is really a whole-time job. Though I appreciate the activities of the Commissioners in setting up that Joint Council, I do not feel that it is going to be satisfactory, because men who are eminent enough to be qualified to plan England from the forest point of view are much sought after in their own businesses and occupations, and you cannot expect them to give up the requisite time. I maintain that some standing machinery is essential. Then I should like to see a really qualified land consultant on the Forestry Commission, and a report made by the Commission on other countries which are dealing with this sort of problem, especially Germany. That is my first suggestion. My second suggestion is the most important one. A plan of England is essential showing the areas of natural or historic landscape beauty which must not be disturbed, and areas suitable for afforestation. If that were done on a large enough scale, it would show the areas suitable for afforestation in which the Commissioners might consider the purchase of land. That is the only possible way in which anxiety, such as is felt in Northumberland, can be allayed. I think that people would rather know the worst about their favourite areas than be in a state of constant anxiety. Thirdly, I think that the Commission has to reach a decision on the question of the proportions of conifers and hardwoods. There are magnificent potentialities, but I would remind the Commission that the problem cannot be solved satisfactorily by putting fringes of hard woods on the edges of coniferous plantations. The Commission ought to be allowed by their terms of reference to consider their work from the broadest point of view of the national interest treated as a whole. If that would mean revised terms of reference, then I would ask for revised terms of reference. I will conclude a very long and rather boring speech by a short homily addressed both to the Commissioners and to the public. One of the causes of the present confusion is that our idea of beauty in the landscape is accepted beauty, that is, that to which we are accustomed. The accustomed landscape is made up of hard wood plantations and forests planted mainly for economic reasons. The most beautiful woods in this country were planted for economic reasons. The new afforestation is also planted for economic reasons, but of a different kind. There is only one way out, and that is the acceptance of the principle that there can be beauty-perhaps a different sort of beauty-no less in the new landscape. It is a different orientation of our ideas, and if the Commissioners are empowered to proceed on a large enough scale, the potentialities are magnificent. Side by side with this there must be planting of areas beforehand-in short, a long distance policy. It is that for which I ask as a result of this Debate.'];;negative
1945-11-14a.2184.4.txt;;['I beg to move, That the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board-Constructional Scheme No. 2 Confirmation Order, 1945, dated 22nd August, 1945, made under the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Act, 1943, a copy of which Order was presented on 23rd August, be annulled. In moving this Motion, which I realise is a serious thing to do, and no doubt an unpopular step to take, I would like to make it plain to the House at the outset that I only decided to do so after the most serious and earnest consideration. I have lived in the district concerned, I have walked over almost every yard of the ground affected and have seen for myself precisely what is involved in this major operation of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. I have also attended the public inquiry and studied the evidence given before that tribunal. It would be an under-statement to say that I speak only for my constituents, because I have reason to know that large numbers of people on both sides of the Border who love historic Perthshire and the central Highlands, view with genuine alarm what is proposed under this scheme. As the House knows, the scheme has been confirmed by the Secretary of State, but the final responsibility, as is right, rests with this House under Section 5 (5) of the Act of 1943. We are all agreed about the vital part to be played by hydro-electricity in the development of Scotland for the future of our country. I do not think we shall be selfish about it, or allow any sectional interest or view to stand in the way of progress. We are all agreed on developing our national wealth, and we know that certain beauty spots may have to be sacrificed in the present age, and that, here and there, beauty may have to give way to utility and service. No one wants more than I do to see a rapid development of the electricity supply, especially to our farms and crofts throughout rural Scotland, but I think the House will also agree that the beauty of the glorious lochs and majestic rivers of Scotland, as well as the latent power hidden in them, is equally a part of our inheritance, and if that inheritance does not demand a fierce uncompromising protection, it at least demands our most serious consideration before drastic hands are laid upon them, and they are removed from the scene for all time. When the Hydro-electric Development Act was before the House I was on the other side of the House, and I believed, as I think the majority of hon. Members believed, that the special Amenity Committee set up under that Act was specifically appointed for the very purpose of giving us adequate protection against the destruction of amenities. The Amenity Committee was, in fact, to be the bulwark against any possible engineering irresponsibility. Hon. Members know that the Committee has rejected that part of the scheme with which I am concerned. Further, the future livelihood and the general welfare of the people affected cannot be lightly brushed aside. Was not the main purpose of the Act of 1943 to foster and increase the welfare of the people of the Highlands? The case, I submit, against this scheme is not based solely on agricultural grounds, although serious damage is to be done to the agricultural industry. Nor is it based on the adverse report of the Fisheries Committee which recommended that certain parts of the scheme should be abandoned. That aspect of the case will be dealt with probably by one of my hon. Friends. My case is simply that the price to be extracted in the loss of amenity from one of the loveliest parts of Scotland is too stiff a price to pay even for power, and that it was never the intention of Parliament, in giving powers to the Board, to allow them to endanger a countryside so lovely and so famous. Further, at a time when everything possible should be done to encourage the tourist industry, upon which this district entirely depends for its livelihood, one of the most famous tourist centres in the whole of Scotland is to suffer irreparable damage. I find it impossible to reconcile the proposal with that of the Secretary of State to set up a special expert committee to go into the whole question of the future of the tourist industry with the object of suggesting schemes for the encouragement of that industry and to increase the population of our Scottish tourist centres. Yet we are starting off by boxing the landscape and ruining one of the most famous tourist centres in the whole of our country, and certainly the most famous in the Central Highlands. If the ex-Secretary of State were here, I think even he would concede that the Hydro Electric Board committed a major blunder when right at the beginning of their existence they decided to launch out on one of the most controversial schemes it was possible to imagine. When this deed is done the beauty of the heart of Scotland will be forever broken. Once this amenity is destroyed and the natural beauty of the district damaged, it can never be replaced. According to the Board\'s own survey, this scheme will contribute only one-twentieth part of the untapped energy still available in the Highlands of Scotland. Is it to be wondered at, there lore, that the public, even after an inquiry, are still unconvinced that such a drastic scheme is necessary, or that those of us who supported the Act of 1943 ever contemplated a plan endangering a countryside so rich in natural beauty and known to tourists not only here but throughout the world? The development scheme of the Hydro-Electric Board contains 102 different schemes. This is only construction scheme No. 2, and I refuse to believe that no alternative could be found to this scheme that would not do the damage that it will do. I do not want to weary the House by plunging into the details as to what is involved in this scheme. It has engendered so much heat already and there has been so much publicity about it, that it is not necessary for me to say very much about the scheme itself. But it is necessary for me to say a word about the position, and if I may attempt to present to hon. Members a picture of what is to happen, they would see a power dam thrown across the River Tummel right on Pitlochry\'s doorstep, coming up almost to the town itself. The resulting reservoir overflows the road to the Pass of Killicrankie, eliminating that beautiful stretch of the River Tummel which most of us know so well, sweeping away with it the river sidewalks and also the unique Highlands Games Ground, which has taken its place in the Highland Calendar, for I do not know how long. Old Cluny bridge that we love so well will disappear, and the famous Falls of Tummel, recently given to the National Trust, will be no more. The Garry becomes a mere burn, and the Pass of Killicrankie becomes a rockery memory. Further, think what the Falls of Bruar and the Falls of Struan both mean to Pitlochry, because motor coaches come from that town with visitors. Both these disappear. Finally, Loch Tummel is swollen to twice its size, inundating large areas of agricultural land and throwing out the prospect of muddy flats at the further end of the loch. If the scheme would have been of any use to the district perhaps even the loss of the Falls of Bruar and of Struan could have been tolerated, but it is the disfigurement at Pitlochry that rankles and has caused so much bitterness. No amount of tinkering by any architect, however skilled, can possibly compensate for these things. There are 18 separate works including three reservoirs, three generating stations and seven aqueducts, the whole affecting an area of 322 square miles of the county of Perth. If anyone wants to see what is to happen, I recommend that they should see the "Illustrated London News" of a fortnight ago, where they will see what is being swept away. I think the House will agree that this is a stiff price to pay, and the price is made doubly stiff because of the fact that no possible benefit comes to the people who are to foot the bill. Some hon. Members may know that Pitlochry lies in the heart of the Central Highlands, and 50,000 visitors come to it every year quite apart from those who come for the day in motor coaches. Large numbers of these people are working people from Dundee, Perth and other industrial areas, who have not the time nor money to go further a field. From the point of view of employment, it is Pitlochry and its beauty that has produced so much prosperity for its many hotels and shops. What is contemplated in this scheme, I submit, involves a very heavy sacrifice for these people. They are not being unreasonable about it, but they do feel that their future livelihood, quite apart from the national loss involved, is at stake. We should ask ourselves whether it was ever the intention of Parliament when the Hydro Electricity Act was passed that such a drastic scheme could ever be claimed to be necessary in the public interest, a scheme which I would remind the House was rejected by the specially appointed Amenity Committee, rejected by the Perthshire County Council, the principal local authority, rejected by the National Trust of Scotland and by a host of other people far too numerous to mention. This is not a question of contemplated sabotage of vested interests. There is widespread and intense feeling about it all over the country. I have myself received petitions signed by over 6,000 people. What then has the Amenity Committee set up under this Act to say about it? Has that body any influence at all in determining whether a scheme shall go on or not? Was any other source of supply seriously considered before it was decided to lay hands on a great tourist centre? These are some of the questions we have to ask ourselves. During the Committee stage of the Hydro-Electric Bill, anxiety was expressed by many hon. Members about the loss of amenity. The Secretary of State disarmed the critics by this assurance: I beg the hon. Member and his friends to believe me when I say that this was one determination of the Government-that though we all want electrical development, and want to see the amenities of civilisation provided for the people of the North of Scotland, we do not desire to give powers to any Board to interfere wantonly and unnecessarily with one of our great heritages, the beauty and the glory of the North of Scotland. Later in the same Debate, this is what he said in reply to the hon. and gallant Member for Argyle (Major McCallum), who asked a question on the same subject: If the hon. And gallant Member wants an assurance that we intend to appoint the strongest possible Amenity Committee and to give every assurance to that Amenity Committee that every reasonable recommendation that they make will be strongly enforced and backed up by the Scottish Office, I can cheerfully give him that assurance."-[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May, 1943; Vol. 389, c. 343&#8211;353] What are these assurances worth today? How, in fact, does all this work out in practice? Has the Amenity Committee been unreasonable in its report? The Amenity Committee, after the most careful and deliberate examination of the scheme, recommended by a majority that that part of the scheme which places a power house on the doorstep of Pitlochry should be abandoned. This is what the Amenity Committee said: The Committee considered the effect of the rise and fall of the enlarged Loch Tummel and realised that there may be some unsightly areas at the West end, but they feel that this must be accepted; and further regret the projected disappearance of the Falls of Bruar. They are of opinion, however, that it would in principle be most regrettable that such exceptionally beautiful highland scenery as the lower reaches of the Tummel and the Garry in the vicinity of Pitlochry should be submerged. This scenery is easily accessible to the public and the Committee consider that it should be preserved unspoilt as a national asset. Was that an unreasonable report? The Hydro Board rejected the advice of this committee and, rather surprisingly, at the inquiry it was admitted and adversely commented upon in the Tribunal\'s report that no alternative source of supply had even been seriously considered by the Electricity Commissioners and the Central Electricity Board. That comment is made in paragraph 20 of the Tribunal\'s report. Equally curious is the fact that in paragraph 41 this failure to consider any alternative source of supply is actually taken as justification for approving the Tummel Garry scheme to the extent that the reinforcement and backing of the Scottish Office contained in the Secretary of State\'s assurance that I have already quoted is not disclosed. I think we can assume that if it existed at all it has been extraordinarily ineffective. The objections of the local authority, which the right hon. and learned Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid), who was Lord Advocate at the time, told us in the Committee stage would be a powerful factor at any inquiry, have been swept aside as though they were of no account. What does all this mean? Surely that the Amenity Committee is as dead as mutton. Its influence has been precisely nil. It was a waste of time setting it up. Whether we like it or not, we have to admit that a complete breakthrough has been achieved by the Board\'s mechanised forces, and, as far as I can see-and I have given a good deal of study to this matter-there is nothing whatever to stop them fanning out over the whole of Scotland, like a gigantic squadron of bulldozers, as my hon. Friend said, fanning out over the whole country and eliminating everything, including statutory committees and local authorities. It is clear to anyone who has studied the Tribunal\'s report, from paragraphs 17 and 27, that all that is necessary is for the Hydro-Electric Board to get a certificate from the Central Electricity Board to the effect that they are short of power. When they have got their certificate they can push through any scheme, because then it is held to be in the public interest to do it. It is admitted in paragraph 27 of the Tribunal\'s report that considerations of amenity were not even taken into account by the Electricity Commissioners. This question, it says, is left to the two statutory committees. The whole thing is beautifully arranged. The inquiry quite clearly shows that the Tummel Garry scheme was selected simply because it was most convenient for the supply of the Central Electricity Board, whose sole concern is to supply industrial England and some parts of Scotland. The Commissioners and the Electricity Board, who appear to be quite inseparable so far as I can find out, and neither of whom are located in Scotland, are in complete control. Nothing can be done without their consent, but anything can be done at their command. It is not the needs of the Highlands that constitute the governing factor. I submit that that is contrary to the intention of Parliament when we put this Bill through the House. It is quite clear that the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board can snap its fingers at anyone, safe in the knowledge that they have in their possession a certificate from the Central Electricity Board stating that they are short of power, and they can reject the recommendations of the Amenity and Fisheries statutory Committees with impunity. That was the big shock that the public got at the public-inquiry. I put it to the hon. Gentleman who is going to reply: surely it is time they should put their cards on the table face upwards and abolish all these committees altogether instead of misleading this House and the public in this way. I would not be surprised if these committees abolished themselves altogether. What is their future? They have nothing to which to look forward, and no work to do. Their appointment has turned out to be a sham, and the assurances given by the former Secretary of State, although at the time they seemed to me to be as clear as water, have turned out to be just as thin. No part of Scotland is now safe from the Hydro-Electric Board, and any further inquiries will be a waste of time. If this scheme does not constitute an invasion of the beauties of Scotland-what the former Secretary of State called the beauty and the glory of the North of Scotland-I would like the Minister to tell me what is an invasion. The Amenity Committee think it is an invasion, the National Trust for Scotland think it is an invasion, the Perthshire County Council, who are to gain GBP 20,000 in rates, think it is an invasion, or they would not oppose it, and so do a great multitude of people all over Great Britain. But the Hydro-Electric Board can wash out the lot if it can urge that power is required. I cannot believe that when the Hydro-Electric Bill went through this House it was the intention of Parliament, or even of the late Secretary of State, to give such powers to any board. The Tummel Garry scheme is the most radical of its kind ever produced or that can ever be produced. It is not a case of a remote glen like Loch Sloy. It is not comparable to the Galloway scheme, where the tourist industry is widely scattered. What would have happened if beautiful Glen Trool had been taken? It was saved by being taken over by the Forestry Commission. Durham and Lincoln have both been threatened by electricity development, but they have succeeded in avoiding destruction of their amenities. Perthshire has a small popu- lation and is a rural area. It has already paid the price of the existing Grampian scheme, and must again foot the bill. I do not think that the relentless nature of this scheme should have been tolerated at any time. If someone could show me that some direct benefit was to come to the local community, I might have to say that there was something good in this scheme after all, but that is not so. If hon. Members will look at page 9, paragraph 16, of the Tribunal\'s Report, they will see these words: No direct benefit to local consumers is contemplated.\'\' Pitlochry and district get neither current nor cash. They suffer both ways. Most of those hon. Members who supported the Hydro-Electric Act in 1943, did so because of the promises held out for direct benefit to the Highlands of Scotland. The Measure was clear on that point. It told the Board to meet the needs of the ordinary consumers, including those in isolated areas. The Minister in charge of the Bill made it clear that the Central Electricity Board would only be supplied on that basis. What do we find now? Those priorities have been completely reversed. First on the list are our old friends the Central Electricity Board again, because they are short of power. The hope for benefit to the Highlands seems to me a very long way off. What about the new industries for these areas and for Scotland? Have the Government any other industries, apart from this generation of electricity? What are the electricity plans for Scotland? If it is Perthshire\'s turn today it will be someone else\'s turn tomorrow. Are not the local authorities entitled to an answer to their questions? The whole of Scotland are entitled to know. Finally, I wish to emphasise again that out of 6,000,000,000 units estimated to be available from the Highlands of Scotland, only 300,000,000, or one-twentieth part, will be contributed by this scheme. I submit that it cannot be maintained that this scheme is essential to the development of Highlands water power as a whole. An immense responsibility rests upon us tonight in the knowledge that this is a great test case, not only for the Hydro-Electric Board but for other people. We know that the statutory committees are as dead as the dodo. No county councils in Scotland are powerful enough to oppose this scheme, and all inquiries are a farce and a waste of time. Even the veto of Parliament ceases to be a safeguard. There is a reference in Clause 9 to the fact that an Order must be placed on the Table and if within 40 days it is challenged it will be withdrawn, without prejudice to another scheme coming forward. Within 40 days we can do something about it, but the Highlands people believe that Parliament should have the final say. It is no good saying that the Secretary of State, having confirmed the scheme, must therefore have it, supported by the Government\'s majority. This is not a party issue and this matter should be left to a free vote of the House. We have twice tonight heard the word "bulldozer." This same bulldozer effect will be in evidence if this scheme is carried in the Lobbies of this House through the overwhelming Government majority. Let us remember the effect of this scheme, and protest against such arbitrary action. The safeguards are of no use at all, and it is clear that far more oppressive powers than were ever intended have been given to this all-powerful corporation. It is our duty to refuse to approve the scheme. The Hydro-Electric Board ought to reconsider their policy and produce a scheme which will give us the current we require for what has long been recognised as one of the most beautiful and famous parts in the whole of Scotland.'];;positive

1963-07-24a.1467.4.txt;;["With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to make a statement about forestry policy. In his statement on the Government's forestry policy in July, 1958, my predecessor said that the size of subsequent Forestry Commission programmes, and the structure of grants to private woodland owners, would be reviewed in five years time. This review has now been held, and the Government have reached the following conclusions on it. Over the next decade, from 1964 to 1973, the Forestry Commission will aim at planting a further 450,000 acres. It will continue to concentrate on acquiring land in the upland areas, particularly in Scotland and Wales, where population is declining and where the expansion of forestry can bring considerable social and employment benefits. The Commission will be able to acquire land in other areas where there are good economic reasons or where planting can maintain or improve the beauty of the landscape. The planting programme for each year, and its distribution between the three countries, will be determined from time to time by the forestry Ministers. The Commission, in preparing its future programmes, will bear in mind the need, wherever possible, to provide public access and recreation, and will devote more attention to increasing the beauty of the landscape. We propose to make no change in the structure of the present grants to private woodland owners. Under our existing arrangements, the level of grants is examined every three years to take account of changes in costs and receipts. The latest of these reviews is in progress at the moment. The Government welcome the increasing acreage of timber planted by private owners. The tradition of skill and knowledge which has been built up and the research which has been carried out in private forests has been of great benefit to the nation. The continuation of the grants to the private woodlands confirms the Government's confidence in private forestry and provides support for its continued place in our national forest policy. Our policy of steady expansion in both public and private forestry means that a growing volume of home-produced timber will be coming on to the market, to the benefit of our balance of payments. As the volume increases, so it will become more clearly necessary for the Commission, the private interests and the trade to pay greater attention to the whole problem of the marketing and use of home-grown timber. Moreover, the steady expansion in home production will give the timber trade confidence to develop its plans for handling home-produced timber as it comes forward."];;positive
1969-03-25a.1356.2.txt;;['The subject I wish to raise tonight will, I hope, have attached to it none of the acrimony which attended the first debate on the Bill. I am arguing that the need for planning, preservation and development be considered on a national basis. I aim to initiate a discussion inside and outside the House because it is a subject upon which there should be a proper partnership between Government, Parliament and the public. We should have far more planning on a national basis, planning by consent, evolved rather than imposed from Whitehall or Westminster. Many of the distressing aspects of the present situation are due to the imposition of plans dreamt up by those who had perhaps not the proper touch with the people for whom they planned. Planning should be a positive process rather than a purely negative one, as it is too often today. What I have to say has little to do with the National-economic-Plan, about which we heard so much some years ago, although development-industrial, commercial and other forms-has a considerable bearing upon our environment, and obviously the economic situation will affect what is done. We live in a crowded island and a highly developed society-too crowded most would agree. In addition, it is a society which has become perhaps too complex for many of us. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton) has done much valuable work and had a long correspondence with the Prime Minister, which has been published, on the population problem. I hope that it will be studied by hon. Members and many others outside the House. It is not primarily with that problem that I want to deal this evening, although obviously planning on the scale and with the sympathy for which I am asking must take account of an increase in the population, although some of the figures which have been given are perhaps too alarming. We can all agree that our surroundings have a very considerable effect upon our lives, and that in our work or at leisure, we can find ourselves employed infinitely more effectively if we are surrounded by beauty rather than by ugliness and squalor. The land is infinitely precious, and it is not something which can be lacerated by road, rail, air, power, pipes and wires, and all the other interests which attack it, without injury, some of which may be permanent, or at least last for more than one generation. The first item mentioned in the title of my debate is preservation, and I would say a word about that before passing on to other matters. There is first preservation of the land and scenery. Scenery is something built up over the years, in most cases over the centuries. What man has done to the scene, although it may be a grave injury, has often been a recent intrusion and the scenery which we most enjoy has been there for many centuries. No amount of landscaping by Ministerial experts or local authority experts, or even private experts, can undo damage of certain kinds; no planting of shrubs or rows of geraniums or rows of Japanese flowering cherries can replace a cherished landscape where English oaks have grown and matured over three centuries. Nothing can replace them if a wrong decision is made. Then there are buildings. Taken in isolation, buildings are seldom worth preserving, but one must look to their surroundings. The Gowers Report, which many regard as almost the Bible on the subject of planning and preservation of items of historical interest, went out of its way to stress the importance of preservation and enhancing the appearance of buildings of importance. Yet it has taken years of endless frustration in this House to get the first Civic Amenities Act, and then the provisions in the latest Town and Country Planning Measure. I remember introducing a Bill, the precursor of the Civic Amenities Act, which was blocked by my own party. For that they should be ashamed of themselves. There are many building of immense significance which have received grants from the Historic Buildings Council and which have had thousands of pounds of private money and years of loving care lavished upon them which are even now threatened by a by-pass or some other man-made threat. There are many buildings which have been the subject of immense expenditure and care but whose surroundings, because of the lack of planning in the past, are, if not ruined, then considerably damaged. Nothing is now being done to improve these surroundings. Hardly a day goes by but we hear of some new threat to something which is priceless and which the nation-and I stress the nation, not just the private or public owner-cannot afford to lose. The House will have noticed the Motion, signed by well over 100 Members, concerning the threat to Levens Park in Westmorland. I have no wish to enter into a debate on that subject. It would be unfair to the Ministry of Transport, which is principally concerned, to do so. I merely wish to say that this is a piece of landscape which has enjoyed public access for more than three centuries and has on it trees which cannot be replaced. It has a wealth of animal, bird and aquatic life, and the scenery is so splendid that it has attracted the attention of David Cox, de Wint, Girtin and many others. I do not believe that the present threat would have become so ominous if the full picture had been available to all concerned in good time. I feel hopeful that the good sense of the Minister of Transport, who is now so personally involved, will prevail, and that an act of real statesmanship will save this unique part of our landscape. Centuries from now we shall earn the condemnation of our heirs if we do not act with good sense in such cases. I have spoken of the threat from the road, Roads are most unpleasant things. They are a scar on the landscape which is slow to heal. They bring vehicles, sometimes recklessly driven, usually noisy, and often smelly. Vehicles could perhaps be designed which had neither noise nor smell, and then so much happier would we all be. As this Government, in particular, are so interested in every facet of life, I wonder what they are doing to press on with research to see whether road users can be made less intrusive and obnoxious. Much of the trouble from roads would be abated if those who travel on them were not so offensive to the countryside or townscape through which the road passes. How much better it is to design a bypass or a through route, if a through route is needed, than to indulge in piecemeal improvement and destroy the places we aim to save. How many small towns and villages have had their guts torn out by road widening and such other improvements before the bypass is built? We would restore life to many of our villages by getting rid of the traffic which thunders through them. We must make the decision in time before the villages are completely destroyed. The Ministry of Power, with its pipes and wires and power stations, has much to answer for. Why is it not possible to aim at concentrating the wires of the C.E.G.B., the railways and the through route by road all along one valley instead of spreading their nuisances over such a wide area? I wonder why the public bodies which deal with the telephones, electricity, radio and television must have so many wires disfiguring the countryside and the towns. Has any real thought been given to the design of the necessary pieces of equipment? Must we have frightful square transformer boxes stuck up on poles in every pleasant field through which a wire passes? Does the electricity authority from time to time consider the mess it is creating and wonder how it can simplify it? I can answer that question. The answer is, no, unless prodded by a locally interested person. The landscape can often be greatly improved by people getting together and planning an improvement. I have been attacking various de-flowerers of the landscape, as they might be called. I propose in the next part of my speech not to make an attack but to turn my spotlight on the amenity societies because they, too, could do more by collaborating to a much greater degree. The Civic Trust has a fine overall record. Would that its work could go even further. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings does good work in connection with early buildings, but it makes a special point of not concerning itself with land, so that it will not act to protect the surroundings. The Georgian Group is admirably concerned with Georgian buildings. The Victorian Society has its own special field of operations. I wish that there was more collaboration between them. The C.P.R.E. does good work in the countryside, but the C.L.A. must also be involved. Only recently it was discovered that there was no effective group of people looking after the interests of historic buildings, in public and private ownership. It took the initiative of the British Travel Association, which is concerned with tourism, to set up, first, an advisory committee and then a more permanent body representing private owners of historic buildings, the National Trust, the Ministry of Public Building and Works and all the other organisations concerned. It is surprising that that committee came into operation only three years ago. There was no proper collaboration between all these bodies which were trying to do much the same concerning historic buildings. There is a national responsibility for buildings and the countryside. The National Trust does an admirable job. But it must be brought into closer partnership with the private people concerned. We have heard the plea that National Trust land should be inalienable and that once it belongs to the National Trust it cannot be disturbed. I hope that we shall give this matter a little thought because the ownership of a piece of land-it might not be of agricultural use, and it might not be particularly attractive to look at-by the National Trust might positively steer a new road or some other unpleasant development straight into an historic building or another piece of land of great significance in private ownership. We must aim at a proper partnership between the National Trust and other trusts and all the interests concerned, because there are many beautiful pieces of countryside and many fine buildings not in the National Trust\'s hands which could be damaged as a result of Trust ownership of adjacent properties. I hope that more preservation trusts will be set up. It is possible under present charity legislation for money to be devoted to this purpose. There are few privileges which the National Trust enjoys which could not be enjoyed by trusts set up for a similar purpose. Just as in private enterprise health insurance I would hope that British United Provident would not have a perpetual monopoly, so I feel certain that the National Trust could do with some competition as it finds it difficult to administer all that it now owns. I could continue with my list of offenders-and local government would come high on the list. Some local planning departments are very ignorant, particularly about historic buildings, and seem insensitive to scenery. One has only to look at the actions of the park departments in some of our big cities to realise that to them landscaping simply means rows of geraniums. We have had a similar intrusion in Bristol in a landscape by Humphry Repton. It may be that some of my friends in Bristol like rows of geraniums in a Repton landscape. But these are small matters compared with the ignorance displayed by many planning departments. One could forgive it if they would follow professional advice when it is available. I believe that most councils have, or certainly could have, an advisory panel of independent architects to help them. I remember in a county well known to me-I am not speaking of Bristol-a frightful decision having been made about the amenities of a fine building. When I asked what the advisory committee of architects had said about this piece of bad planning, I was told, "We did not think it was anything to do with them". There is not only ignorance, but a lack of enthusiasm, to put it mildly, to consult those who could help. There are those who are above the law, the Service Ministries in particular. I would say a word in their defence, because they are not as bad as some would have it. If a large tract of countryside is in the hands of a Service Ministry and perhaps used for a rifle range or worse, that piece of land has at least been saved from development, and perhaps 50 years from now when it is relinquished we shall be delighted to find that there is one large area of our country-or, as a Dorset resident, I would say "county"-which has been saved from the developer. It may be that land which now causes so much trouble in the Isle of Purbeck will one day become a great beauty spot because the military were there for a century and stopped other men from spoiling it. Nevertheless, the Service Departments must take their share of the blame, in that many of the things erected by them are not objects of beauty. Worst of all, they fail to take them away when they have finished with them, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will say a word in the ear of some of his right hon. Friends on this matter. Nationalised industries are outside planning altogether. I accept the doctrine that the Crown must be paramount and must not be put in the position of having to ask permission from a committee before it acts. Here there could perhaps be more friendly collaboration. Even the Church is not without blame. The Measure designed to deal with redundant churches which was before us recently did not meet with universal approval; almost every speech but one was critical. This scheme left in the hands of the Church of England the demolition of any building that it was determined to demolish, and funds for repair and renewal were to be made available only to those buildings which had reached a state of redundancy. All manner of frightful things might happen to a building on the way to redundancy, and the building might be quite irredeemable before it became redundant. The Church does not have a very good record for maintenance. During the last 100 years the death-watch beetle has begun to show, and I am always distressed to hear of GBP 10,000 or GBP 20,000 being needed to save a roof when perhaps a little more care during the last 50 years would have reduced that budget by more than half. I have given a catalogue of villains in which I must include the private developer and the private citizen, because we are all to blame. So often we are insensitive in our choice of materials. A laudable scheme of housing may be ruined by the use of uncompromising materials. It is no good saying that the material will weather in time. There are certain types of red brick and concrete blocks which will not weather in a century, no matter how much mud is rubbed into them or how many fast-growing Leyland cypresses are planted round them. The Minister might like to see what his friends in the Forestry Commission are doing to propagate the fastest growing of all the conifers, the Leyland cypress, which can now be grown in vast numbers thanks to mist propagation. It is able to grow at the rate of 2 ft. 6 ins. a year and can be used to hide hideous bricks and concrete. It might be said that my remarks have been somewhat random. This is a very big subject, and the House might ask me what I am proposing to do about it. I do not believe that some omnipotent new planning procedure is the answer. As I said at the beginning, I do not believe in imposing plans. They should be evolved. That means that people matter, and that the planning must start with the people in the locality; but there must be better collaboration between all those interested. When people are together round a table discussing a project or an area of countryside, the first requirement is for a map, and maps are sadly lacking. The 25 in. Ordance map was created in the 1880s. The maps for certain areas have been brought up to date but not all. We need a 25 in. map of the entire country, up to date, constantly revised, with the revisions available. With all the magic of photo-copying, it is perfectly possible to photograph a map that was drawn yesterday for distribution to all who need it. The map should show all the features of significance, both scenic and man-made, not forgetting vistas and views, which are not always easily seen from a map. I should have thought that the planners would be able to spot an avenue and would know that it would not be a good idea to build a row of red brick council houses at the end of it, but they cannot. If one stands in the front door of Montacute House, Somerset, looking down the magnificent drive, one sees at the end one and a half red brick council houses in an otherwise open landscape. The same thing happens opposite the great gate of St. Osyth\'s Priory, in Essex, although there there is a pleasant crescent of council houses, and I am told that the planting of suitable creepers and trees has resulted in their looking quite attractive. But the point is that they need not have been built there. There are also caravan sites and railway sidings which surround historic buildings of great significance. Some of these happened in the nineteenth century, but some are still happening. The map should also show mature woodlands. There are various symbols for a tree on the Ordnance Survey map, but one is not able to tell from the symbol what one needs to know. Buildings should also be shown, grade 1, grade 2 starred, grade 2 and even grade 3, and also groups of buildings. No map shows groups of buildings of architectural and historic significance, although I recognise that grants have been made towards the repair of groups of buildings, none of which is of the first class. Properly constructed, up-to-date maps of the kind I am suggesting would be of great assistance. If in the local planning office there were put on the wall a map of the area covered by the planning authority, officers would think twice before suggesting to their committees the sort of proposals which are put into effect. This properly constructed map, like the 39 Articles, should be the guideline on which we should proceed. Having got the map, one can designate the areas which are suitable for certain kinds of development, by which I mean not just the creation of new work but perhaps the removal of old. Under the conservation area procedure, it can be done, though I doubt whether much demolition will take place. However, if one designates an area for improvement, it should be the conscious effort of the local authority and others who can be brought into its confidence to improve that area and then all those areas where it is decided that development should take place. If one can sort out the various needs and requirements, one might get a great deal more; done in the way of dealing with our housing problem, which the right hon. Gentleman assured the nation recently was nearing its end-[Interruption.] The right hon. Gentleman disagrees. I heard the television broadcast, and I thought he meant that there would be a surplus in many areas though there would still be problems elsewhere. In certain places we are nearing the end of the problem, and that will make planning easier. There way be other areas where there is great pressure for land. With a more sensible designation of what should go where, it may be that a flood of land would come on the market. There is an immense amount of waste in planning at present. There is waste where land is built up, and that leads to the destruction of new land. The right hon. Gentleman will not agree with me when I say that we should repeal all the Rent Acts and, by so doing, make for a much greater mobility and also make it very much easier to redevelop entire streets or neighbourhoods. At the present time, only local authorities can do this, and they have limited resources. I would like to see the scrapping of the Rent Acts, so enabling large areas of Victorian suburban houses with substantial gardens to be redeveloped as neighbourhoods, where one could end up with a greater density of people living in much better surroundings. In my part of the world, for example, there are many large Victorian houses which are occupied by small families. Much of the available accommodation is empty. Their owners fear to let it in case they find themselves with tenants for life. That is another matter, I know, but it may be that it has a bearing on the general problem. I have covered a very wide area, but I hope that I have given the Minister a little to think about. I know he cares very much about the matters which I discussed at the beginning of my speech, and I am sure that he will agree that the present situation is not entirely satisfactory. I hope he will be able to give an undertaking tonight that the Government regard the whole matter as one of the greatest importance. I am sure that he will acknowledge that all is not well and that present policy does not provide all the safeguards that we need, in that it does not bring into partnership all the interests concerned. We must think of the long-distant future, not just of the next generation, but of the next, the next and the next. If we want our age to be remembered at all, I hope that it will be that we recognise at last the unique value of our landscape and the varied buildings which man has created and, I hope, will go on creating upon it. I hope that we shall be remembered for recognising that ugly surroundings make for ugly lives. We can make a better future for our children\'s children if we tackle the problem, but it must be tackled now. This is our last chance. Let us begin by the short discussion that we have had this evening and hope that the Minister will be able to give us some cheerful thoughts from this Government.'];;neutral

1973-07-24a.1533.1.txt;;["In discussing these regulations we are discussing not a new concept but the continuation or improvement, as the Minister says, of existing schemes. Generally in most industries throughout the world there has been an enlargement of units. The agriculture industry has been no exception. We all want the British farmer and the British farm worker to earn their true worth. If this helps in that process, we agree with it. There are, however, one or two points about which we should elicit a little more information. There have been changing circumstances in the past few years which may cause people to quibble about certain aspects of the scheme. The first point is that this is not something confined to Britain. The problem exists throughout the world, especially in Europe. We have seen in Europe a great programme of amalgamations. Many of us feel that the amalgamations and the concentration of farming communities have not proceeded fast enough, but they have their own schemes to encourage farmers to form larger units. I wonder whether any of the common agricultural fund is used to finance this series of amalgamations in Britain as in France and other European countries. Another worrying fact is that there have been changes in the past few years and one of them has been in the land ownership of farmland in Britain. This has caused a great deal of concern, not least amongst the farming community. One has only to read the farmers' various journals to find the letter columns therein concerned about this problem where land prices have shot up to an astronomical level. They have created farms which are at paper value very high yet when the farmer dies his son faces almost impossible and crippling estate duties. This escalation or explosion in land values does not help the farming industry. We must try to ascertain whether these schemes, and previous schemes, help to accentuate this move. While we, on the one hand, want an efficient farming community and accept that in many cases farms must be bigger, we are concerned to ensure that those farms are not always owned by City institutions or by foreign banks. This problem is not confined to Britain. The Danes only a matter of weeks ago introduced very stringent controls on the ownership of farm land. Will the Minister comment whether, when he was drawing up these new arrangements in this scheme, he considered the possibility of allowing encouragement only where the new farm was to be owned or managed by a farmer and not to be used to facilitate some further capital investment? It seems to us not good for the future if we find these big financial institutions buying up farmland, not primarily to farm, for at the rate of return possible from farming, in spite of welcome increases in farmers' incomes over the last few years, they cannot get the return which they would get in the cities. It has been commented that on the present trend of farm amalgamations, and the change of ownership, by the end of the century nine-tenths of the farmers in this country will be working for city institutions. This may be an exaggerated claim but it has been made. I am sure the Minister has seen it in the farming Press. To turn to a different aspect of the order, the Minister mentioned that these schemes affect land which is going into afforestation. This is something which we on this side of the House welcome, because there has been a great deal of concern about the lack of land going into afforestation. This problem has been made worse since June 1970. The forestry industry in this country has felt a little sterile. Having seen the Government's consultative paper, it has waited for 13 months for a statement on the Government's forestry policy. We are still waiting. As a result there has been a drying up of land being provided for afforestation. Could the Minister give us an estimate whether he feels that these schemes, which allow land to be released for afforestation, will help? The problem is very serious. The Forestry Commission throughout Britain is drawing upon its reserves. The result has been that in this year-Plant a Tree Year, ironically-the new planting by the Forestry Commission has fallen from 57,000 trees in 1971 to 51,000 in 1973. Many of us feel that that is not good for the forestry industry, or for the economy of the country as a whole. Of course, the Forestry Commission's task has been made more difficult by the increase in land prices and not least for all the reasons which I have explained. The Minister said that land would not be eligible for a grant if it was to be used for afforestation unless the Minister judged that it was more suitable for afforestation than it was for agriculture. That is a fairly sensible rule. It has been a rule which has been applied de facto if not dejure to the Forestry Commission's acquisitions over the past few years, but it has not been applied to private forestry. That has been one of the reasons for the outcry against afforestation. There has been much public concern about the afforestation of good private agricultural land about which the Minister had no say. Does the new scheme apply to the private sector as well as to the State sector? The next point which the Minister raised was land which is released for public use. That is something which we very much welcome. I query one point -namely, if land in a national park is to be released to the national park authority for recreational purposes, does the farmer as well as the national park authority purchasing the land get a grant out of the public purse for that purpose? The Opposition welcome public access and the general development of amenities and recreational facilities. But while we all want more efficient farming communities, We are concerned that in certain parts of the country the landscape of which we are all fond-I am thinking of the upland areas in the national parks-is dependent on the living farming community. No one should be unaware of that point. The Opposition are worried that it may well be that with increased aids there will be a change in the farming community and in the landscape that will not always be desirable. I query one or two technical points. As I understand it, the idea is to get amalgamation to aim at 600 standard man days. That is a sensible, useful and viable farming organisation. I am trying to ascertain whether a grant is payable if a new unit is formed which comprises less than 600 standard man days. If that is the case, difficulties might arise in certain parts of the country. I have tried to get some random statistics for North Westmorland and parts of the Lake District. The statistics show that no less than 68 per cent. of the farms in North Westmorland are classified as having less than 600 standard man days. If the figures are broken down, no less than 35 per cent. of the farms have less than 450 man days. That is when there are taken into account all farms over 250 standard man days and there are ignored the smaller farms which would be included under the scheme and which complicate the matter further. That means that in many parts of the upland areas there are a considerable percentage of farms of less than 300 standard man days. Therefore, one might get a situation where two farms of less than 300 standard man days are to be merged. In that instance, would the farms be eligible for the grant? Generally we welcome these proposals, but we are worried about the changing situation of farm ownership and the possible effect on the environment. We dope that the Minister will keep under continuous review the effect of the scheme, because if there is any danger urgent action would be needed to remedy it."];;neutral
1973-11-16a.913.1.txt;;['I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) for initiating this debate, because, as he said, it is a long time since we discussed forestry in the House. I recognise the strength of his argument about expansion. My hon. Friend quoted the import figures for last year and this year. It is probably glaringly obvious to say that no planting that we do now will help us much in the very near future, but I take on board his point that imports of timber are very substantial. My hon. Friend asked me about the possibility of an EEC directive having effect in this country. There is no likelihood of this in the immediate future, and the statement which I made in answer to a Question in the House, while recognising the existence of that directive, was not in any way influenced by it. I wish to go back to the time last year when the Government\'s consultative document first saw the light of day. Many people had their misgivings about whether it was in fact consultative and was not rather a declaration of Government intent. No one can have any doubts about that now, because consultations have taken place on the widest of scales. I myself have had prolonged discussions with a delegation from the trade unions led by Mr. Jack Jones; with representatives of the private forestry interests; with those who came to see me on behalf of the timber trade; and many others. My hon. Friends with responsibilities for forestry in the Welsh and Scottish Offices have done likewise and there have, of course, been parallel consultations between the environmental Ministers and the local authority and other amenity interests. To all those who have submitted their views, either orally or in writing, I would like to pay grateful thanks on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the work done, the help given and the advice always so generously offered by the Chairman of the Forestry Commission, Lord Taylor of Gryfe. The result of these consultations is to be found in the reply I gave to my right hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate (Mr. Ramsden) on 24th October last, and I think it not unfair to claim that the reaction of those interested in forestry has been one of cautious welcome-my hon. Friend used the phrase "mixed welcome", and I shall not quarrel about that-cautious because only the broad framework of Government policy has been announced. Discussions on the detailed application of it are now going on. What caused great dismay among private foresters was the suggestion in the consultative document that the dedication scheme should be ended so far as new entrants were concerned. Indeed, despite frequent ministerial assurances to the contrary, it was widely supposed that the ending of dedication applied to those who had entered into covenants already. In fact, as was made clear, it was always a case of suspension, as opposed to finality. The Government wanted to look at the future of the whole of the forestry industry after a gap of some 30 years since the previous review, and dedication was an important feature of the private sector. Forestry is, I suppose, the use of land with the longest cycle involved. I often think that a six or seven year rotation on a farm is not exactly short term in the planning and management which it calls for; but it is small stuff compared with forestry. Good management is essential to good forestry, and a dedication covenant ensures that management is good. Indeed, in entering into one, owners of private woodlands voluntarily enter into an obligation which deprives them of freedom to manage their own property as they choose-and that is no mean sacrifice to make; but they make it because, like most of those who have any responsibility for the land of this country, they attach an importance upon which it is hard to place a value to what lies within their care. My experience is that those who own and manage woodlands, be they the commission or private individuals, take their responsibilities every bit as seriously as anyone else. The Government have thus decided to retain dedication, albeit in a rather different form. Until last year one dedicated for all time. We think it makes a more workable proposition to dedicate a forest or plantation for its lifetime. When it is felled, its successor can be considered for dedication in its turn. In order to qualify for the grants which a dedicated woodland will earn certain new conditions must be fulfilled. To put them in their simplest form-the country must be kept beautiful and the land used well. Hardwoods take a very long time to grow, but so much are they a feature of our countryside-particularly in England and in Wales-that we want to encourage the planting of them. This is why the Government\'s announcement contained the news that a significantly higher grant would be paid for hardwood planting. We want too to spread abroad the enlightened approach which both the commission and many private owners are already showing in giving the public access to their woods. This is where the Ramblers\' Association comes in. Camping sites and woodland trails in private woods in Westmorland and further north; log cabins put by the Forestry Commission by the side of Loch Lubnaig on the way from Doon to the West of Scotland-all this enables the people of this densely populated island to appreciate forestry and the value it has for the country. This, I am afraid, takes me on to my hobbyhorse. We are, as I have just said, one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Moreover, the population continues to increase, while the motorways and the housing schemes remove land at a rate of between 50,000 and 60,000 acres a year. We cannot therefore afford to see land used other than to really good effect. Hill farming, on land where many of the trees are likely to be planted, must be in good heart, and if hill farming is in the dumps, as it was not long ago, vast areas of conifers will be planted in a way which does not use land to the best effect. There are those who always have looked and always will look upon forestry and farming as being in competition with one another. They are, I am afraid, so wrong-and so blind. No one who is interested in this subject and who has passed by that high, high town of Tomintoul in Banffshire can fail to have noticed and be impressed by the way in which the Forestry Commission has planted its forests in Glenlivit, to the enormous benefit to those whose farms are adjacent to them. The same can be said of a private estate near Fort William, where what used to be poor stock-carrying land has been improved, thanks to the shelter given by well-placed woods, many times over. My own farm on the northern slopes of the Lammermuirs, which, like every other farm, is the most difficult farm in the country, would be a hard, windswept place without the 120 acres of plantations which guard its 600 acres from the winds that sweep in from the Bass Rock in the North Sea or storm down across Soutra Hills. So foresters, farmers and those who have an eye for the landscape must get together. They will do so on the Forestry Commission\'s regional advisory committees, which are to be reconstituted, so as to bring together forestry, agricultural, amenity and planning interests with a new mandate both to discern the broad area strategy for rural land use and to advise on cases of doubt in the administration of grants to private woodland owners. In this way, for the first time, the Forestry Commission will have at its elbow a network of expert and representative groups which can help to reconcile the demands which agriculture, forestry and amenity are making-and will continue to make-upon our diminishing reservoir of rural land. It is a long time since many words have been spoken on forestry in the House. I again thank my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity of putting some of my thoughts on record. I note the points that he made with such clarity about the need for expansion and will certainly draw them to the attention of my right hon. Friend.'];;positive
1977-05-05a.705.4.txt;;["The previous debate on sport and recreation was unfortunately curtailed. I am sure that many hon. Members had valuable contributions to make to it but did not get the opportunity to do that. Therefore, I am sure that all those who are interested in this subject will be glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister responsible for sport has been able to secure time for this debate. I am not sure whether this is the second half, or the second leg. After the Division just now, I heard someone demanding a replay. But however we see it, this debate is very welcome. I shall be as brief as possible, so that as many hon. Members as possible will have the opportunity to make contributions. The previous debate also tended to concentrate very largely on spectator sports. That was understandable, since it was timely then to discuss the subject of football hooliganism, which has been disturbing us all. Nevertheless, one of the main aims of my right hon. Friend's policy has been to widen the Government's interest so that it covered not only sport but the whole field of recreation. I consider it essential that we should take such an interest if only because its scale shows what an important part it plays in people's everyday lives. I mention angling as a particularly powerful example. It has nearly 3 million regular participants. Informal countryside recreation such as pleasure motoring, picnicking and sightseeing attracts enormous numbers of people. Two recent studies, for instance, suggested that on an average summer weekend in the South-East not far short of 3 million trips were made to the countryside and to stately homes. At the national level there is a broad estimate of about 275 million trips to the countryside per year in England and Wales. During the previous debate reference was made to the size of the grant to the Sports Council, which this year isGBP 11&#183;5 million. I wish it could be more, as I do on so many other items of Government expenditure, but even in the present very severe financial constraints I think that it compares very favourably with the grant in the final year of the previous Administration. However, the real point that I want to make is that the Sports Council grant is only a very small part of total public spending on sport and recreation. Taken in isolation, it presents a very misleading picture. It is the local authorities which are the major providers of recreational facilities. The accepted figure for local authority spending on sport and recreation used in the rate support grant discussions for the current year wasGBP 332 million, a large proportion of which will be supplied by central Government. In looking at recreation, the Government's r&#244;le is not to control but to coordinate and to give a lead. In the previous debate my right hon. Friend explained the arrangements for coordination not only with his Government colleagues but with the numerous agencies that have an interest in the subject. At the regional level a key r&#244;le will be played by the regional councils for sport and recreation, which were set up last year. Their range of activities is very wide indeed, as can be seen from their terms of reference. They are, within a region, to provide a forum for consultation among local authorities and a wide range of user and other affected interests, to promote the general development of public participation and of appropriate provision to meet growing demands and, more specifically, to promote the preparation of long-term proposals for the planned provision of sport and recreation. In all this the councils have due regard for the conservation of the natural environment, the needs of agriculture and forestry and the needs of people living and working in rural areas. At least half the membership of a regional council will come from the local authorities and one quarter from interests such as indoor sports, outdoor sports, general outdoor recreation, countryside conservation and land-owning and farming. In the previous debate some criticism was voiced that sport was under-represented on the councils. I think that this criticism neglects the r&#244;le of the local authorities as the major providers of recreational facilities. I think that I would also want to say that much of our problem in the past year has been in convincing countryside and conservation interests that sport was not over-represented. Some teething troubles have been inevitable, but our clear impression is that the councils are settling down well and have shown a commendable determination to make things work. I hope that both sides of the House can give them the support they need at the outset of their work. The regional councils have a wide remit, but they will be giving particular attention to the part that sport and recreation can play in helping to tackle the problems of urban deprivation. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment made an announcement recently about the additional resources that the Government are making available to encourage programmes and facilities in the inner areas of some of our major cities. The regional councils can, we believe, have an invaluable r&#244;le to play in giving advice on the vital social dimension represented by participation in sport and recreation. The Government's new approach to the inner cities comes at a time of exciting new thinking about recreation in urban areas. There have been two studies on leisure provision. The first, which was carried out by a research worker in my Department, was to find out more about the kinds of activities and policies that could help increase the recreational opportunities of those living in the inner cities, especially those who are socially, economically or physically disadvantaged. The second, sponsored jointly by my Department, the Department of Education and Science, and the Scottish and Welsh Offices, is on action-research experiments in leisure activities in four selected areas-Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Clwyd and Dumbarton. We intend making every effort to publish the results of these two studies before the Summer Recess. This will ensure the early publicity and discusssion that I believe to be necessary. We are also going ahead with plans for regional conferences on the studies to be held in the autumn of this year. There is a clear need, in the present difficult times, to ensure that recreation facilities are provided for those who need them most. There is tremendous potential for self-help in the community, and this must be harnessed through more flexible and sensitive attitudes on the part of local authorities. There is, as well, great scope for utilising existing under-used resources, such as parks, schools and church halls. The question of joint use of recreational facilities in schools has been much in the news recently and it is a matter on which my right hon. Friend and I will shortly be having further discussions with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Science. It is a subject to which we attach the greatest importance. We must make every effort to utilise resources at educational establishments for the benefit of the whole community, particularly at a time when economic stringency militates against the provision of major new facilities. I know that additional costs inevitably occur which place further burdens on the already stretched finances of local authorities, and I for one appreciate the very real difficulties that often stand in the way of opening up these facilities outside normal school hours. I worked for several years in a secondary school which was used as a youth club most evenings. On the other hand, I later went to a school which was three years old but whose excellent stage, with its very expensive lighting equipment, had never been used by the school or by any other organisation. I know that there may be staffing and cleaning difficulties, but while some local authorities have already embraced the concept of joint use, and have gone to considerable trouble to put it into practice, the response of others has been disappointing. In parallel with the new thinking on the approach to recreation in urban areas, we shall also be publishing shortly a paper to stimulate public debate on the approach to leisure in the countryside. This has been prepared by the Countryside Review Committee, which is an inter-departmental committee of officials carrying out a wide-ranging review of policies affecting the countryside. Our objective in the countryside was originally spelt out in the 1966 White Paper in which we said: Townspeople ought to be able to spend their leisure in the country if they want to&#8230;the problem is to enable them to enjoy this leisure without harm to those who live and work in the country and without spoiling what they go to the countryside to seek. The objective remains the same today. But the problem of reconciling the potentially conflicting requirements of recreation and other uses of the countryside has been made even more acute by the continuing growth in countryside recreation. How best to weave these various uses together is the subject of the paper that I have mentioned. Of the many problems of recreation in the countryside, I shall mention but three. The first of these is the urban fringe-the area around our great conurbations. Definitions of this vary, but it can perhaps best be defined as the land between the continuous built-up areas of cities or large towns and the open countryside around. These areas are particularly important for recreation, especially for those who live in city centres and are without private transport. They are, therefore, relatively deprived of open space. Clearly, the urban fringe must provide valuable opportunities for recreation. But how should we go about providing such opportunities? The Countryside Commission has already pointed the way with some pioneer experiments in the urban fringe of Greater Manchester and London. I hope that hon. Members for London constituencies will forgive me if I mention first the work going on in my area. The commission has been helping with the reclamation of derelict land in river valleys, tree planting, general landscape improvement works and provision for informal recreation facilities, such as picnic areas, footpath and bridleway systems, and information facilities. The commission has also engaged the Civic Trust for the North-West to carry out an experimental project to promote recreational use, to encourage conservation and to stimulate local interest in the Tame Valley. In the London area, two experiments have been set up in conjunction with local authorities in Barnet and Havering. This work is intended to minimise friction between farmers, local landowners and visitors through exploring management agreements and helping with minor physical works. The commission has carried out many smaller projects in other urban fringe areas, and is at present undertaking a research study to examine the nature and extent of agricultural changes in urban fringe areas to identify the characteristics of farming in those areas and the differences between regions. Besides the Countryside Commission's work, I should also like to mention the value of projects such as the Lea Valley Regional Park, which I visited a few months ago. There provision has skilfully been made for a wide range of facilities in the recognition that some kinds of formal or indoor recreation may be valuable to widen appeal, increase usage on wet days, and provide a distinct blend of recreational experience. It contains a number of attractions which would be unacceptable in the deep countryside areas such as the national parks. These facilities include, for example, cycle tracks, artificial ski slopes, water ski-ing, equestrian centres, and a range of indoor sports. In the wilder countryside beyond the urban fringe, I know that there is particular concern about the problem of recreational usage of our national parks. The Labour movement can be rightly proud of the part that it played in establishing these areas for public enjoyment. But I doubt whether the founding fathers had any idea of the weight of visitor and vehicle pressure to which the parks are subject today. Our problem is that the national parks have two statutory purposes-the preservation and enhancement of natural beauty and the promotion of their enjoyment by the public. We have agreed that, in the last resort, priority must be given to the preservation of natural beauty. But, equally, we believe that much can be done to reconcile the two purposes by good planning and management. One step is to try to spread the load more evenly. This involves the promotion of alternative areas for people to visit. The Countryside Commission has done considerable work in this respect by, for example, supporting the setting up of country parks, of which there are now nearly 150 in existence. The regional recreational strategies to be prepared by the regional councils for sport and recreation will take this work an important step further. Much can also be achieved within the parks themselves by sensible management schemes. One story of successful co-operation between farmers and visitors took place in the Lake District. Known as the Lake District Upland Management Experiment-UMEX-the project started in 1969 as a joint initiative by the Countryside Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. From 1973 until it ended in 1976, the work was sponsored by the commission and the Lake District Special Planning Board. The aim of the scheme was to test whether, by means of a little financial encouragement to farmers, the interests of both farmers and visitors to the uplands could be met. This has enabled farmers to carry out small schemes to improve the landscape and enhance the recreational opportunities of the area. It has also enabled the effects of this work on the attitudes of farmers towards recreation and the landscape to be assessed. A characteristic of the project was the flexible administrative arrangements, its success leading to the provision of a permanent Upland Management Service covering the whole of the Lake District National Park. Indeed, several other national parks authorities have now established their own upland management services. Another area of leisure in the countryside which is assuming an increasing importance is tent camping and caravanning. This is now very big business as more and more people take to this form of recreation and holiday. Nearly 4 million people went camping in 1970, and it is forecast that between 5 million and 5 1/2million will be doing so by 1980. In 1974 about 350,000 caravans were in use. Camping and caravanning is a very worthwhile, healthy activity, and I welcome the increasing opportunities that have become available to a wide range of social groups to take part in it. Camping, however, does bring with it its attendant problems, particularly in the more popular holiday areas at peak periods of the year. Overcrowding of sites, with attendant risks to health and safety, traffic congestion in the approaches to sites and illegal camping, all pose severe problems. Existing controls are inadequate, particularly in health and safety matters, and a new initiative by Government is clearly desirable. I do not, however, believe that all our problems can be solved simply by the improvement of controls. If supply and demand are out of balance, these problems will continue to exist. I recognise that many authorities are already under very serious pressure and that some of the more popular spots have now reached virtual saturation point. We need, therefore, to take a new look at the problem to see how we can develop a co-ordinated approach to improving site provision, particularly in the more popular areas at peak periods of the year. I want next to turn to a subject which I believe is important to outdoors recreation. I have already spoken about the great potential for leisure which exists in the countryside for the community at large. Education for its better use and understanding is vitally important. We must find ways to help both adults and children to understand and care for the natural evironment. I have been pleased to see that a great deal of work in this field has already been done, and that interest in environmental education is growing fast, both at home and abroad. The pressures in the natural environment are growing through ever-increasing social and economic demands. We all know well that these pressures come from society's continuing drive for better living standards. The Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council both appreciate the importance of environmental education in their work, and I am encouraged to see that they have actively promoted it. The Countryside Commission, for instance, has put a great deal of work into its visitor centres, which are designed to interpret the areas around them, to explain the natural characteristics of the area and, of course, to increase public awareness of the value of conserving them. The Countryside Commission and the Forestry Commission have also begun to develop a series of guided walks through areas of particular interest, often on a theme relevant to the characteristics of the area. Education of the adult, I believe, will be far more effective if such education is begun in childhood. That is why I firmly believe that our main priority for environmental education should be in our schools. There is already a great deal of enthusiasm for the environmental education of children, as, indeed, is shown by the large number of study centres set up in our national parks. Indeed, I hope that local authorities and individual schools will consult more with the national parks and the Countyside Commission before planning these, but as yet there is no sign of their enthusiasm. We must look carefully at how environmental studies are taught in our schools. This is something that we shall again be discussing with my colleagues in the Department of Education and Science. I do not regard this as a demarcation problem between two departments of Government. There is a need for both Departments to be closely involved in this work. Although I can see a need for improved guidance in these matters, I should not wish to stifle initiative or to blunt enthusiasm. That is why I attach particular importance to the r&#244;le of the voluntary organisations in the field and, of course, to the Government agencies which I have mentioned. The work they do to stimulate environmental education by aiding and encouraging schools and other bodies who are interested is invaluable. The Council for Environmental Education, for example, provide a means of communication between schools and teachers on the one hand and conservation and ecological groups on the other. I aim to keep that enthusiasm going, as I am sure that we can only benefit from a greater understanding and appreciation of our environment. The White Paper covers a very wide field. In the course of the two debates my right hon. Friend and I have dealt with some of the subjects, but not all. One particular point of interest to me has been the increase in the facilities for the disabled-usually provided, I may say, not by other bodies but by the intelligence and enthusiasm of the disabled themselves. There are in my area-as I am sure there are in a great many other areas now-clubs for the multidisabled, and the standard they achieve in various activities is indeed remarkable. The White Paper recognises that the physically handicapped must be given the opportunity to participate in recreational activities, not only by using facilities specially designed for them but by sharing as many facilities and activities as is practicable with their families and the community at large. The Sports Council is empowered to make grants for the adaptation of existing buildings for sport and recreational purposes, including appropriate provision for the disabled. The council also produces advisory documents aimed at bringing home to all those who provide sports facilities the necessity of taking account of the needs of the disabled."];;positive
1984-06-18a.119.0.txt;;['I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Heddle) for raising this important subject and for demonstrating that he has had a wide and varied interest in this important issue for a long time. He has identified the wider interest outside the House. My hon. Friend has described the versatility and importance of the whole subject. The debate on a national land use survey is related closely to the concerns of the recently published report of the Select Committee on the Environment. I pay tribute to its work. It dealt with the need to protect green belts, to encourage urban regeneration and to make adequate land available for development. The Government\'s commitment to these aims is enshrined in the circular advice which my Department gives to local authorities in the exercise of their planning functions. I agree that a new comprehensive land use survey, repeated at regular intervals, would be a most useful indicator of how far we are succeeding in our pursuit of these aims and in the preservation of the countryside in general. I endorse what my hon. Friend said about our priceless asset. The Environment Committee\'s report on green belt and land for housing was received last week and is being studied. My hon. Friend will appreciate that I cannot make a fuller comment at present. The Government will respond to the report in due course. The report includes comments on the draft green belt and land for housing circulars published for consultation in February. My right hon. Friend expects to publish these circulars shortly, having taken account of the Committee\'s comments on them. Going out on the ground to complete such comprehensive surveys is labour-intensive and therefore costly, especially if they are to be completed in a short space of time and we need to be confident about their accuracy. My Department has therefore for some time been considering other possibilities ranging from ground sample methods to the employment of the new remote sensing devices carried by aircraft or satellite. Some provide information which can be stored in digital form and processed automatically. Regrettably, in spite of the technical advances which have been made in recent years, I am advised that none of the remote sensing methods available at present offers images with a clarity of resolution sufficient to interpret changes in the extent of urban land use categories with acceptable accuracy. This is especially the case for the survey of the fringes of urban areas where they intermingle with the surrounding countryside. My Department has also turned to other statistical means of gaining land use information. At present, for net changes out of farmland and into a broad urban use category, we rely on the data supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from questions asked of farmers in their annual June census. But the statistical reliability of this source is such that the data are made available only at the national level and as annual averages over five years. Although they are limited in scope, these figures have provided useful measures of the success of our policies guarding against unnecessary loss of agricultural land. These losses should be placed in perspective. About 75 per cent. of English land, where the population pressures are greatest, is still in farming use and another 6 per cent. is under forestry or woodland. These percentages are even higher for Wales and the United Kingdom as a whole. The Ministry of Agriculture\'s figures for transfers from agriculture to urban development go back to the 1920s. They show that the average loss to urban development, following the introduction of the town and country planning system, is substantially lower than it was pre-war. The downward trend is best illustrated by the estimates for England and Wales, where the figures are the most complete. They show that transfers from agriculture to a wide range of urban developments, including roads and quarries, averaged about 42,000 acres for each year between 1965 and 1970. But that is compared with yearly averages of 62,000 acres in the 1930s, when there was a boom in house-building. The latest figures available, up to 1981, show much lower averages of 19,000 acres. I wish to show no complacency. The recession of two or three years ago may well have lowered the figures. Our policies must continue to ensure that only the minimum of agricultural land, preferably of the lowest qualities, is taken for development and that no land is so damaged that it cannot be used, eventually, either for development or farming. My hon. Friend has been a diligent questioner about the success of the land register initiative in securing the release of unused public land. I share his view entirely. It is true that there is no room for complacency. Some 112,000 acres of idle land are on the registers, and nearly half of it appears to be suitable for development. We cannot afford to let assets lie fallow in this way. But I must beg to differ slightly from my hon. Friend when he says that land registers are not working as they should. Since the scheme began, 9,315 acres of registered land have been sold and a further 4,276 acres have been removed from the registers because the land has been brought into use in the public sector. The six-monthly return for 1 January showed in fact a marked acceleration in this turnover. Moreover, over a third of the land which remains on the registers is available for disposal. The power to direct the disposal of a particular land register site has not been used yet, but my right hon. Friend is ready to use it when he is satisfied that it would be justifiable to do so in relation to a particular site. In the past, for the three years from 1975 to 1978, statistical information on land use changes was sought from local authorities. It looked to be a promising approach, but most authorities proved unable to supply the information required. On taking office, we reached the conclusion that the results were inadequate in relation to the effort involved and we asked officials to investigate improvements urgently. My Department has been fortunate in having free access to complete air-photo cover of the country flown by the Royal Air Force in 1969. During the 1970s this was analysed in land use terms by consultants and the results were published in 1978. Unfortunately, such are the limitations on the interpretation of aerial photographs for small areas of development, that the results, although comprehensive in national coverage and giving a very good idea of the broad extent of urban development some 15 years ago, provide use categories which are not relatable in any direct sense to the other sources of land use, stock or change data. So far, I have referred to the past efforts made by my Department in this direction because it is important to understand them. I am also aware of the considerable work by notable academics in achieving surveys and estimates of urban and rural land use. A first effort at a survey of the whole country was undertaken by Professor Stamp in the 1930s, but that concentrated on rural land utilisation. Estimates of the total urban area, at that time, were derived from it. I am also aware of the work done by Miss Alice Coleman of King\'s college, London, which my hon. Friend mentioned, in directing a survey on a roughly comparable basis during the 1960s. Inevitably, that also took a long time to complete. Currently, the Land Decade Educational Council, a private body, has as one of its aims the promotion of further land utilisation surveys at regular intervals. It would like the first one to be completed in 1986-the 900th anniversary of Domesday. But in this connection perhaps I can emphasise the point that neither we nor the council as far as I know, is interested in registers of property holdings on the lines of the original Domesday Book. The current interest is in what is happening to the broad patterns of the use of our land-for example, its use for housing or industry or agriculture, the scenic patterns of the landscape, and its coverage of fields, woodlands and natural features - all of which my hon. Friend mentioned - to provide policy indications for the Government, its agencies, such as the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council, and the local authorities of how far planning and conservation policies are guiding change. With this aim very much in our minds, and taking note of constructive comments from outside bodies, the Department has recently undertaken some further initiatives in the development of methods for monitoring change and periodic survey. For the past two or three years, departmental efforts in this direction have been devoted mainly to the possibilities of gaining up-to-date information about change in urban land use, especially developments on agricultural land, and about changes to rural landscape features. We have taken the view that a better understanding of the rate and pattern of change appears to offer the most effective means of providing early results for evaluating our policies rather than seeking the full picture of our stock of land uses or landscape coverage. Those two main initiatives on land use and landscape change are related but are seeking to measure different things. From studies of alternative methods of getting statistics on changes to urban land use initiated by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment, when he was Minister for Local Government and Environmental Services, it emerged that the most economical approach would be to build upon the map revision work of the ordnance survey. I am not sure that I carry my hon. Friend entirely with me on this subject, but the revision is being undertaken consistently and continuously and, naturally, it is done in a most professional way. The survey programmes are devised on the basis of intelligence received from several sources, including local authorities, about change on the ground. Some areas and some kinds of change-mainly the urban extensions-are surveyed more frequently and therefore kept more up to date than others. But over time the whole country is covered Pilot studies have been completed, and I am proposing to seek a contract with the ordnance survey for it to record and supply land use change information on a regular basis for an initial period of three years starting in January 1985. The costs of the raw data will be small, as the ordnance survey will be charging only the marginal cost of noting, on our special form, locational references and changes to parcels of land use as they are being surveyed for map revision. Information on some 19 categories of urban and rural land use will be collected from those data. We would expect within two years of the starting date to have a good demonstration of the broad patterns of changing land use at national and regional level. Later, when we have received more observations, we would expect to give fuller details, possibly down to county level and for special areas such as green belts and national parks, of changes between the most important individual categories of land use. Our other initiative has been to examine ways of improving information on rural landscape change in conjunction with the Countryside Commission. This type of monitoring is important because there is no ready-made surveying process like that of the ordnance survey. Proposals were invited from survey firms, research centres and Government agencies to establish the current, past and future distribution and extent of important landscape features. A methodology is now being developed by the chosen contractor with advice from other interested agencies and Government Departments. It uses a sampling frame based on previous work done by the Forestry Commission. Within the sample areas, the coverage of landscape features will be determined using a mixture of aerial photography, satellite imagery and ground survey. By "features" I mean land, cultivated or under grass, woodlands, trees, walls, hedges, and so on. The sampling method is expected to provide statistics on the stock of such features at national, regional and possibly county levels, for 1981, 1971 and 1961, so that change can be assessed at a known level of statistical reliability. Perhaps I should mention that we are also looking to the Nature Conservancy Council for information regarding the change in extent of habitats of nature conservation importance. My officials are in close contact with the NCC survey, which will provide complementary information to the landscape study. The two departmental monitoring initiatives will be to a great degree complementary. One deals with aspects of change to the coverage of countryside features and the other is primarily concerned with current changes to urban land use-that is, "development". However, such change data, despite their immediate value for policy purposes, can provide only year-by-year comparisons of how land is changing use. They provide no sign of what percentage of land in a use has changed. To achieve that, data on the present stock of land are needed and my Department is also at present considering ways of achieving this. I have mentioned that the Land Decade Education Council has for some time been promoting its ideas for a national land utilisation survey. It has been in touch with my Department, and, I understand, with the European Commission, which may provide financial support. Full ground surveys are expensive. I note that the recent report of the Select Committee on the Environment quoted a sum of GBP 7 million for a wide survey. It also recommends that a study of alternative methods should be undertaken. I am happy to say that we are already considering such a study as the next step. What seems to be required first is an examination of all the latest developments. The study should cover ground surveys, remote sensing, which is already under consideration for the landscape monitoring project, and the interpretation of ordnance survey maps. It should consider the possibilities of both full and sample surveys. The prime aim would be to produce a stock survey compatible in terms of definitions and areas with the land use change monitoring exercise. It may become apparent through the study that there are fruitful was of merging data from various sources which could be tested in field trials. I am therefore commissioning such a study. Among other things it will, I hope, give us a better idea of the likely cost so that we can then decide whether what we get-with whatever data limitations are involved - would represent good value for money. In conclusion, the case of a national land use survey is under urgent consideration by the Government. My hon. Friend\'s contribution this evening will be of great benefit to us, and I hope that we can maintain close contract so that we can use his advice and experience, and that of other sources. The contribution of improved land use information to policy-making is already recognised, but to technical problems are complex and the costs could therefore be prohibitive. However, we have taken some tentative but constructive first steps to explore ways of overcoming the major problems that have dogged past attempts to establish comprehensive and reliable statistics on urban land use and landscape coverage. The debate has been constructive, and I am most grateful to my hon. Friend.'];;neutral
1987-02-25a.393.2.txt;;['The purpose of this debate is to highlight one of the most significant and allembracing dilemmas relating to land use that has been faced by any Government of this country for many years. What will the British countryside look like in the 1990s? What will be there? Will there be more towns, more fields under cultivation, or just waste land, more derelict land, more factories? I believe that we are at the dawn of a new era-a new agricultural revolution. For many of us it is so close that perhaps we cannot see what is happening. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Minister for Environment, Countryside and Planning has thought this a sufficiently important debate to come here tonight to reply to it. It shows that the Government are seriously considering the issues that I shall raise. I also welcome my hon. Friends the Members for Torridge and Devon, West (Sir P. Mills), who is well known for his expertise in agricultural matters, and for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Heddle) who, as the Conservative Chairman of the Environment Committee, is an expert in planning and other matters. I thank the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the National Farmers Union, Strutt and Parker, the well-known surveyors, and the South Hams Society, among others, for writing to me with their views on this debate. The nature of the problem is that, with the temporary exception of sheep, all agricultural produce is in surplus. Advances in technology, bio-engineering and veterinary science have resulted in an enormous speeding up of production, more crops, more milk and bigger and better animals. We can produce more than ever before on less and less land. The parallel is, perhaps, with the microchip. More energy is being created in smaller and smaller spaces. In just 13 years- in the year 2000- according to John North, an agricultural expert at Cambridge, the current levels of agricultural production can be maintained but using 10 million acres less land. Even allowing for the current take-up rate of land, which is about 15 per cent. a year in new forests and woodlands, Mr. North estimates that in 13 years there will be a net surplus of 8&#183;25 million acres of vacant land which was formerly used for agriculture. In geographical terms, that is equivalent to four times the area of the entire county of Devon. That land will be redundant for agricultural use in 13 years\' time. Put another way, 35,000 productive agricultural holdings currently in use will become surplus to requirements. That means 65,000 farmers and agricultural workers, presently employed on the land, becoming redundant by the year 2000. Of course, there is a knock-on effect. The countryside is more than a food factory. A farmer is not just a food producer but part of the rural economy and rural society. For that reason, the Government must make preparations. Just as Joseph caused Pharaoh to make provision for the lean years during the years of plenty, so, too, must we plan how to restrict our food growth before we find that it is too late. We must also plan what we must do with the land saved. Never before in our history has this situation existed. Successive Governments have told farmers to produce more and more. Now there is so much food in surplus that the EEC spends $203 million a week on food storage, subsidy and destruction. The surpluses are fast getting worse. The ever-growing food surplus is adding approximately $13 a week to every household food bill. It is no good telling farmers that they should be grateful for EEC subsidies. Few farmers make fortunes, and most just manage to make a living. The land, which was their most important and valuable asset, is beginning to waste away. The Government\'s Alternative Land Use and Rural Economy Committee rightly recognised the problem. The announcement two weeks ago attempted to suggest ways in which alternative sources of income for farmers could be provided. But will they? To what extent can the Government make up the shortfall that is lost by quotas? If the proposals are supposed to cope with the effect of reduced farm incomes from a small milk quota, what must the Government do when quotas hit every foodstuff-not just milk-and not just by 10 per cent. or 13 per cent., but by 50 per cent? What will the countryside look like? What will Britain look like from the air, from a road, or from a train? The answer is intimately connected with what the Government will do to help farmers. The key to land use is how farms will be kept viable. How will farmers be kept solvent? The countryside could remain largely as it looks today. There is no reason why it should not, provided a different system of subsidy is created by the European Community. If the Commission said to farmers, "Look, we shall pay you a good sum of money, and all you need to do is to mow your fields, but please do not produce any food," it would solve the problem. But at what cost? Another approach could be to pay off the 35,000 agricultural holdings which will be surplus to requirements and make redundant the 65,000 farmers and agricultural workers. But what would happen to the land if that were done? Who would look after and tend it? What would it look like? The Government\'s draft circular suggested ways of switching land use to provide farmers with alternative wealth creation, but forestry will be no panacea for the problem of over-production. It is cheaper to import timber than to grow it domestically. Of course, it takes many years to grow trees. We can limit the number of forests, but can we limit the number of golf courses-that is another of the Government\'s proposals-and camping sites? Does the Minister suggest that a dramatic growth in the number of golf courses will solve the problems facing our farmers? The only way to create golf courses is to build at least 50 houses around the proposed sites to pay for their construction. Is that what my hon. Friend the Minister has in mind? Will the courts sentence young offenders to so many hours on the golf course rather than to so many hours of community service? Camping and caravanning require plenty of time, leisure and money. Do the Government intend to reduce the retirement age and, instead of the 10 Christmas bonus, provide a free tent? Is the landscape to change from wheat fields to caravan parks? Are areas of outstanding natural beauty to be covered with tents? That would not, however, make up the farmers\' shortfall or loss of income from agriculture. Are we to see marginal land, especially on the urban fringe, covered with line after line of houses? What will happen to the 300,000 acres of dormant, derelict land in public ownership in the inner cities? Will it just be ignored? These are very real planning problems. With the issue of these two circulars the Government have embarked on a very dangerous and difficult journey. What is to be done about land use and land surpluses? Farmers must have an alternative use for their land and buildings to supplement their incomes, but what will the landscape look like as a result? There will be a direct connection between the extent to which the Government subsidise unproductive farms and the new look of the countryside. The extent to which the Government permit new development on land formerly used for agriculture and how that is spelt out to planning authorities is crucial. Planners have a habit of doing their own thing. Liverpool, for example, could hardly have looked worse if there had been no planners. Despite every conceivable designation to protect the environment, the planners will be recommending to a district council in south Devon next Tuesday that a 90-van caravan site be approved in one of the 36 areas of outstanding natural beauty in this country- itself on one of the 39 heritage coasts and in an area of great landscape value. The Government may despair of planners and councils and say that it is not the Government\'s fault. But it is for the Government to spell out exactly what is permitted and what they will encourage and to tell their inspectors, on appeal, what they will not have. The better use of redundant farm buildings by small business enterprises and starter workshops would help to augment farmers\' incomes. The Government must be far more liberal in their planning regime with regard to the use of redundant buildings. All those who cherish the unique qualities of the English countryside have a duty to involve themselves in the debate. The Government\'s responsibility is to protect our heritage and countryside. But the farmers must not be abandoned in their hour of need, nor should we delude ourselves that golf courses, a clump of trees here and there, a nature trail, or a caravan park will solve the problem. It will not. A long-term strategy is needed to protect the finest parts of our environment from the threat of tasteless development and the ruination of this green and pleasant land. The conflict is between pensioning off the farmers-making some of them into museum pieces, subsidising them to keep their fields neat and tidy, bringing in busloads of tourists to visit a genuine English farm, meeting the farmer with his slippers and pipe- and exploiting the rapidly growing land bank so as to augment the farmers\' depleted income and put off the evil day when 60,000 farmers will have to be made redundant. It is an entirely new problem. I do not pretend to have a solution, but I can air the grievance and point out the dangers which, if not sympathetically handled by the Government, could cause loss of support among a wide cross-section of people- farmers and farm-related people- who are dedicated to the preservation and conservation of our environment and the national parks. It is strange tht we should be raising this critical matter so late on a Wednesday night, but I believe that our countryside is at risk. The whole nation looks to my hon. Friend the Minister and the Government to find a solution to this inolerably difficult problem.'];;positive
1996-02-21a.335.1.txt;;["My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, and I will consider the legislation to which he has referred. In Wales, only a few thousand red squirrels remain, confined to scattered localities. In northern England, they are found only where greys have not yet established themselves. It is estimated that the largest populations remaining in England are those in Cumbria-my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is in his place-north Lancashire-my right hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble mentioned the island with which he is so familiar-and Northumberland. Those locations contain about 85 per cent. of the total red squirrel population in England. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham rightly said, it seems that Northumberland is relatively important in its red squirrel numbers, in comparison to the rest of the country, and it is therefore vital to safeguard its population from the encroachment of the grey. The steps that I will outline as taking place to prevent the red squirrel from disappearing from this country are fully in accordance with the undertaking to maintain biodiversity which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made at the earth summit at Rio in 1991. I hope that it will be helpful to the House if I put this subject in that context. At that summit, more than 150 countries recognised the importance of maintaining the existing range of fauna and flora species by signing the convention on the conservation of biological diversity. That convention recognised that action must take place locally, nationally and globally, if global biodiversity is to be protected. The conflict that we see in Britain between our native red squirrel and the introduced grey, and the threat that the latter poses to the red squirrel, encapsulates the need for our intervention to prevent a species from disappearing from our shores and perhaps further afield. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of the recognition of the importance of conserving biodiversity and, in response to the commitment made in article 6 of the biodiversity convention, in January 1994 the Government were the first to publish an action plan to secure that biodiversity. The House may be interested to know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment recently chaired the OECD environment policy committee at ministerial level. The meeting was very successful and identified a number of strategies and tools required to meet the environmental challenge facing OECD countries in the next century. The biodiversity steering group, which was established early in 1994, produced its report and recommendations last December. While the Government will not formally respond to those recommendations until the spring of this year, the recommendations recognise the need to take action at a number of levels to conserve a species' status. The red squirrel is one of 121 species for which the steering group has proposed a species action plan. The plan recommends a set of targets for the species and a range of actions to support those targets. Those actions form a wide-ranging strategy and fall into six broad categories: legislation and policy; site protection; species management and protection; advisory; continued research and monitoring; and communications and publicity. The Government are already carrying out or considering many of those recommendations. I hope that, after hearing what I have to say, my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and the House will be satisfied that the Government are taking seriously the threat to this native species. In the areas of legislation and policy, the red squirrel is afforded the fullest protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under that Act, it is an offence intentionally to kill, injure, take, possess, disturb or sell any wild specimen. Furthermore, in an effort to control its spread, the grey squirrel appears on schedule 9 of the 1981 Act, which lists those species which it is an offence to release or allow to escape into the wild. I hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight says about the circumstances in his constituency. However, with numbers of the larger grey squirrel estimated to be 2.5 million and rapidly encroaching on the remaining red squirrel populations, more positive action is required to address this problem. Additionally, good progress has already been made by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee to complete the first target recommended by the biodiversity steering group, to achieve agreement on a UK red squirrel strategy. Indeed, this strategy is now nearing the end of an extensive consultative process, and is aimed to be published in the spring of this year. The Forestry Commission will in turn be seeking to ensure that the needs of red squirrels are taken into account when indicative forestry strategies are prepared or reviewed. I take on board the important points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham made about the forestry role. In respect of site safeguard, the Government have encouraged their agencies to work closely with conservation organisations to meet this challenge. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Forestry Commission and conservation bodies are currently developing a strategy to maintain the red squirrel in its current strongholds. Management plans for all key sites with viable populations will be prepared and are to be phased, with plans for all marginal sites by the year 2000 and all other sites by 2005. For example, a 2,000-hectare conifer woodland in north Wales has been set up as a special reserve for red squirrels by the Forestry Commission, working with the Countryside Council for Wales. It is generally accepted that greys usually out-compete reds in deciduous woods, while reds are better able to survive in coniferous forests. Grey squirrels are much bigger and heavier than reds, and are better able to compete for the large seeds that many of our broadleaved trees produce-either because they can harvest them before the red squirrel or because they can digest them better. Therefore, in the typical broadleaved British wood, with its mix of oak, beech, hazel and chestnut, the American grey effectively out-competes the British red. The result is that the red squirrel cannot put on enough fat to survive the winter, and either starves or suffers reduced breeding success the following year. Conservationists agree that, over time, red squirrels will disappear from areas invaded by greys. The prognosis is not, however, entirely gloomy because, in mixed coniferous forests, where the small and more nimble reds are better able to access the tiny conifer seeds, scientists currently believe that the British reds can, the House will be pleased to hear, out-compete their American cousins. Government agencies are encouraging research into exactly what type, or more likely mix, of conifer trees are best for red squirrels. This research will consider how we should design such forests so that they may stand as a refuge for the red squirrel. In the Kielder forest-this will be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham-the Forestry Commission is planting Scots pine and Norwegian spruce in preference to the more commonly planted Sitka spruce. These are varieties which produce the larger cones which red squirrels prefer. Although the Kielder forest is currently the only site where the Forestry Commission is actively switching the type of tree being planted, it has produced guidelines for the management of coniferous woodlands, which encourage the planting of large-coned coniferous trees. This policy is aimed at encouraging landscape biodiversity as well as the survival of red squirrels. In the long term, this will be the most efficient way of conserving our red squirrels-managing the habitat so that they can compete for themselves. At a more local level, the Forestry Commission's woodland improvement grant scheme, which was introduced last year, provides one-off grants for work programmes in woods and forests. Although the scheme is currently applicable only to recreational projects, the Government will shortly be considering proposals to extend its scope to other activities. We shall consider my hon. Friend's suggestions during that review process. Action on species management and protection work has been targeted with the development of strategies to guide and co-ordinate work. This has been addressed with a major campaign-Red Alert. I join the tribute which my hon. Friend rightly paid to that campaign. As he said, it has been initiated to raise public awareness. The establishment of a UK squirrel forum brings together Government agencies and interested parties. They all attend the forum to exchange information and to co-ordinate their actions for the benefit of red squirrel conservation. While habitat modification is widely accepted as the long-term solution, in the short term the strategy includes a recommendation to provide food for red squirrels in selective hoppers. That will give the more specialised red squirrel a better chance to survive shortages of its normal food. Consideration is being given to the control of grey squirrels on the borders of red squirrels' territories. It is hoped that, if they are carefully targeted and carried out in conjunction with woodland habitat management, these measures will help to protect the remaining red squirrel strongholds. Importantly, English Nature, the Government's scientific adviser in England, has introduced a species recovery programme, which includes the red squirrel, and aims to achieve long-term sustainable survival of endangered species. English Nature's work has centred largely on Thetford forest, Norfolk, where, jointly with the Forestry Commission, it has been removing grey squirrels from a designated red squirrel reserve and managing the forest to benefit the reds. The project has already seen some positive results, as more red squirrels have been seen in the area recently. However, the population is believed to be too small to be viable in the long term, and some restocking, in partnership with the People's Trust for Endangered Species, will be carried out once an ideal donor population can be identified from the results of a current genetics study. In Scotland, the red squirrel is one of Scottish Natural Heritage's top priority species within its species action programme. The Forestry Commission in particular is undertaking research into methods of controlling grey squirrels. Live trapping is labour-intensive, but it is a commonly used method. I understand that the wildlife trust in my hon. Friend's constituency promotes training courses on live trapping. Warfarin poisoning is possibly as effective if carefully managed, and the Forestry Commission has developed a hopper for dispensing poisoned wheat to grey squirrels, which excludes red squirrels. The Forestry Commission is discussing the use of the poison in this way with the pesticides safety directorate, with the aim of trailing the hopper for wider use in this way in 1997. I understand that the use of the poison in areas not specified in the warfarin order will not require any amendments to legislation, as permission may already be given under the control of pesticides regulations. If the trials are successful, there will be a major advance in controlling greys in areas where red squirrels are found. I appreciate, and I am sure that the House will understand, that many of the public would view the destruction by poisoning of a species to control it as rather brutal, particularly as many people have not seen a red squirrel-that is why the grey squirrel is regarded as a welcome visitor to urban gardens and parks. Conservationists agree, however, that, where there is possible conflict between the two species, the control of the grey squirrel may often be necessary to conserve the red stocks. The Forestry Commission is considering alternatives to warfarin poisoning and is sponsoring a research project at Sheffield university into immuno-sterilisation, making grey squirrels sterile by using a vaccine in food. This is a promising line of research, but, even if it is successful, it will be at least eight years before it can be implemented. Government agencies are asked to provide advice to land managers on the relationship between reds and greys, and appropriate management. Guidance on forestry design has been developed to benefit red squirrels. The Forestry Commission offers advice to landowners in the form of technical publications and personal visits, and through the local squirrel management groups and the squirrel forum, and is preparing a comprehensive report on squirrel management. The commission also chairs the squirrel forum, and is involved in setting up a Scottish squirrel group. Future research and monitoring will undoubtedly be necessary to ensure a secure future for the red squirrel. Many of the measures that I have described this morning will meet that objective. Communicating the issues calmly and concisely to the public and landowners will be important, whatever action is decided on further to protect this species. The issue of the balance between red and grey squirrels can be an emotive one, and it is therefore essential that clear information to explain their relationship is made available to the public. Towards that end, the JNCC UK strategy will be made freely available to everyone. Educational material on the interactions between our native red squirrel and the American grey squirrel should also be made available, particularly to schoolchildren. I hope that my hon. Friend and the House will agree that the Government are taking a wide range of action to preserve this important native species, which will benefit many hon. Members' constituencies that still have red squirrels. I once again pay tribute to my hon. Friend for raising this important subject, on which I am sure the House will hear more."];;positive
1998-07-16a.625.0.txt;;['I am extremely pleased to follow my neighbour, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). I join him in recognising and praising the importance of a Government who are going to deliver on their election promises. The right hon. and learned Gentleman might not be sitting on the Opposition Back Benches now if he had been a member of a Government who could persuade people that they meant what they said and delivered what they promised. The comprehensive spending review and the document "Modern Public Services for Britain-Investing in Reform" give the Labour party an opportunity to forge a new contract with the people-a Government who deliver on their promises. I start by praising my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary for one promise that has had no publicity at all: in opposition, we made the promise that we would stop the large-scale sale of Forestry Commission woodland. Under the Conservative Government, a third of a million acres of woodland was sold; that environment declined, and public access opportunities were lost all over the country. When we came to power, we imposed a moratorium, and the Government have now made it clear that large-scale sales of Forestry Commission land will cease. That will enhance the environment and improve the landscape. That decision has been generally welcomed, but the review goes further. I am pleased that a middle way has been found for the Forestry Commission. The lodges where people stay on holiday are to be refurbished and brought up to modern standards by using private sector finance. We are enhancing the environment and giving people more and better recreation and leisure facilities. Much of the debate on the spending review has concentrated on the extra spending-the inputs on education, health, crime and disorder measures and transport. The shadow Financial Secretary acknowledged that this was the biggest spending bonanza since the war, but he did not seem clear about where he stood; he was not sure whether he was for it or against it. I liked the tack he took-talk about the cavalry charging down the hill to protect and enhance the pay of public sector workers. Cleaners and dustbin men will remember the 18 years under the Tories, and will never see them as saviours. Unlike my colleagues, I want to focus on the processes in the comprehensive spending review, because it is apparent that it contains several measures that are good public and economic policies. When the glitz and presentation has been cut away, what is left is a spending plan over three years that brings consistent and steady growth to public services, especially education and the health service, of about 4 per cent. a year in real terms. That does not sound like a lot, but head teachers, hospital managers and people who work in the public services acknowledge that there is light at the end of the tunnel. What they cannot live with is uncertainty, so having a planning framework of steady, cumulative growth over three years is important to them. Of even greater importance would be to try to ensure that the three-year spending plans were constantly rolled forward, so that there is always a third indicative year. People would then have the opportunity to plan to take on new staff, to take decisions about capital expenditure, and to engage in long-term planning, rather than 12-month planning. I also welcome the set of cross-departmental reviews, on the under-fives, asylum and immigration, crime prevention and the justice system. Those are important, because they show that the Government engage in joined-up thinking and joined-up government. We shall do more of that, and continue to pull Departments together, so that, in crude terms, by adding value to each Department, we get better bangs for our buck. I am delighted that the comprehensive spending review speaks of a regeneration budget, new deals for communities and a revamp of the single regeneration budget that will bring extra resources to our most deprived areas. I say to the Minister: look closely at coalfield communities and at the coalfields task force, which has made 80 recommendations for Departments across Government. Let us use that as a vehicle to bring real change, new investment, new jobs and a new future to coalfield communities. As well as inputs and extra spending, outputs and outcomes are important. I look forward to seeing the detail of the spending agreements and to there being some, shall we say, creative tension among the centre, the Treasury, and the spending Departments. I hope that we will look to spending Departments to make savings, and give them the opportunity to keep some of those savings, because the language of government is the language of priorities. We need to acknowledge that not all public spending is good public spending; we need to ensure that public spending is modern, and goes to the areas of most need. That is why I am keen that we set targets not only for Departments, but for public spending all the way down the scale. I hope that we shall have local contracts between divisional police commanders and their communities, and between head teachers and the community that uses the school, so that people know who is accountable for the services. Targets and timetables should be set, and questions should be asked if they are not delivered. The citizens charter made a good start on that, but the measures were not very sophisticated. They included the number of rings of a telephone and how quickly a report could be produced. We should get out and talk to people about the public services they demand and aspire to-and, what is more, pay for. We have an obligation and a responsibility to provide better services than people are receiving at the moment. I hope that we shall ask hard questions, for example, of police authorities. How many of us, in the Chamber or outside, can name the members of the police authority that shapes our community? Very few of us can do so. We must identify stakeholders and the providers of public services, and set them hard targets. We must also examine mistakes. I have mentioned the police. A great deal needs to be done to make our police force modern. I am ashamed at the amount of sickness in many police forces in this country. It cannot be right that, on any one working day, 1,500 police officers in the Metropolitan police are on sick leave. It cannot be right that there is so much early retirement, not only in the police but in the education service. We need to examine that problem, and manage it much more forcefully than we have done in the past. I sometimes think that public servants are good at managing problems. The issue is our lack of social and public service entrepreneurs-charismatic figures who can find solutions. We must strive to identify the people and organisations that can implement good practice. We need to praise good public services and contrast them with the worst. The problem in recent years is that we have picked on the worst services-we have named and shamed-but we all respond better to praise and reward. I want us to examine public services, reward and support the best, and make them beacons for change. Public services in this country would then be transformed. That leads to implications for the inspectorate-the people who monitor our public services, such as the Audit Commission and the Office for Standards in Education. I have great praise for the Audit Commission, and it does not need to hire a lobbyist to find that out. It is very good at identifying problems, putting forward solutions and suggesting outputs, but it is not good at delivering outcomes. We must set up organisations that support people, love public servants and give people who can achieve the opportunities to do so, such as seminars, extra training and extra resources for their organisation. By praising the best, we can enhance the rest. Ofsted has a great deal to achieve. I note that one of the documents accompanying the comprehensive spending review sets out aims and objectives that Ofsted has set itself, including the objective of getting Investors in People status. I hope that it can move from a negative, Lone Ranger, destructive approach to school inspection towards one that considers and enhances the good aspects and acts as an agent for change. I believe that public services are important, and the public agree, but they must be persuaded that those services are theirs, that they meet their needs and that they are stakeholders in the services. I praise the comprehensive spending review, because it is investment for reform and an opportunity to achieve modern public services. It is a challenge for change. I hope that we shall meet that challenge and make that change.'];;neutral
1998-11-26a.431.0.txt;;["I congratulate the hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) on securing this debate on the important subject of the future status of the New Forest. I am glad to have the opportunity to respond and I pay tribute to him and other hon. Members who have continued to raise the subject in the House. If the hon. Gentleman will pardon me, I shall deal first with a point raised by the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) about Dibden bay. I assure the hon. Member for New Forest, East that I am aware that Associated British Ports in the Southampton area is working on a port expansion on the western bank of Southampton water at the bay. That is to enable the port to attract new, larger, deep-sea container ships, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Proposals for that area are likely to be controversial, not least because of the nature conservation implications and the designation of the Dibden bay foreshore as part of a special protection area for birds. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the site lies in the New Forest district and is close to the New Forest heritage area. Although ABP has not so far submitted applications for the necessary consents, I know that the company has been in discussions with environmental bodies, the relevant local authorities and my officials about the procedures that would be required. Those procedures are complex and various consents are required by the relevant legislation. My understanding is that a harbour revision order would be needed to allow the construction of a new terminal and ABP is also likely to require planning permission for some aspects of the works. Unless objections to the harbour revision order are resolved by negotiation, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will call a public local inquiry, during which time the objectors and any other interested parties may make representations. The final decision would then rest with my right hon. Friend, who is responsible for the Department that I represent. In view of that, it would be improper for me to express any views on the merits or otherwise of the proposals at this stage. However, I thank the hon. Member for New Forest, East for drawing the House's attention to the issue. As is to be expected, there is much interest in the New Forest area about the future status of the forest and the decision that the Government must take about the best way forward, but interest is not confined to the locality or even to the surrounding counties and cities. The New Forest has a special place in the nationally valued landscapes of England and there is, rightly, interest and concern throughout the United Kingdom. As the hon. Member for New Forest, West knows, the issue has a long history. The recent debate on administrative mechanisms occupies but the blink of an eye compared with the long history of the New Forest itself. However, the debate has taken place during a time of unprecedented change in so many of the aspects of human activity that have an impact on the forest, including, for instance, development proposals on a scale and of kinds not previously thought of; economic forces operating at an international level; personal mobility brought about largely through the use of the private car; and new agricultural and forestry techniques which have had an impact across the countryside. Hand in hand with those forces for change has gone an increasing realisation of the importance of conserving and enhancing our most important national areas of landscape beauty. Back in the 1940s, when the areas which would end up as the national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty were being surveyed, the New Forest was left off the list. That decision was undoubtedly profoundly influenced by the fact of Forestry Commission management of the Crown lands, as the hon. Member for New Forest, West has said, and by the special arrangements for the management of the forest under the New Forest Acts, involving the powers of the verderers in regulating commoning. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the position was considered again. The national parks review panel was asked by the Countryside Commission, on behalf of the then Government, to look again at the national parks in England and Wales, 40 years after the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In considering possible new national parks, the review panel considered that the New Forest was worthy of national park status, but suggested tailor-made legislation to take into account the powers and responsibilities of the Forestry Commission and the verderers. The previous Administration accepted that something needed to be done, and in 1992 declared their intention of establishing a new statutory body based on the New Forest committee. Somewhere along the way their resolve faltered rather badly and they changed their mind. Instead, in 1994 they announced that there was no need for any new statutory management body, but that they planned to apply national park planning protection policies within the boundary of the New Forest heritage area. I feel obliged to advise the hon. Member for New Forest, West that even that limited gesture has not worked properly. The previous Government wanted to define the heritage area's boundary through the local plan process, and that has taken so long that it still has not been finalised. To date, because there is no confirmed boundary, it has not been possible to amend the general permitted development order to give full effect to national park planning policies. The Government have therefore asked the Countryside Commission to reconsider the position in the New Forest, and they have firmly re-stated the need for a statutory authority to take over from the voluntary New Forest committee. Before going any further, I would like to pay tribute to the partners in the New Forest committee who have come together voluntarily. They include the local authorities, the Forestry Commission, English Nature, the Countryside Commission and the verderers. The work the New Forest committee has done so far has been invaluable in furthering understanding of the New Forest and in taking forward sympathetic management. To its credit, the committee has co-operated in drawing up a management strategy for the forest and it has pulled in vital funding from Europe in a successful LIFE fund bid. As the hon. Member for New Forest, West rightly said, we should pay tribute to the commoners. I was greatly impressed with them on my recent visit to the New Forest, and, as I said then, it would be strange if they were not there. If they had not existed for so long, it would be necessary for the Government, or for local government, to invent them. However, the New Forest committee is only a voluntary co-ordinating body without statutory powers and responsibilities or a real spending budget. The committee itself, composed of all the bodies that I have mentioned with a stake in the forest, is campaigning for a statutory designation for the forest and for a new statutory authority to be set up to take forward the work which the committee has started. The New Forest committee recognises that further work needs to be done to define exactly the tasks and responsibilities that a new tailor-made authority would have. I know that the committee is holding a seminar on 28 November for stakeholders in the New Forest, to allow people to have their say on what a new statutory authority would do. I look forward to hearing the results and to seeing some specific proposals. The Countryside Commission, in its advice to the Government, suggests that a statutory authority should prepare a statutory management plan, should be able to enter into management agreements and make payments towards the conservation of the forest, and should have a statutory right to be heard on strategic activities affecting the forest. The details of how such a statutory authority would work are not entirely clear. If the Government decided to follow the course that the Countryside Commission regards as its first choice in its advice-that is, a tailor-made authority-all the interests in the New Forest would need to take part in further serious discussions to agree just how they want the arrangements to work. Careful thought would have to be given to how the powers of the new authority would relate to those of existing bodies, in particular the Forestry Commission and the verderers. However, I must stress that the Government have not yet made up their mind on the most effective method for resolving the concerns about the management of the New Forest. Nevertheless, we have been listening carefully to all the arguments. For that reason, I visited the New Forest on 13 October as the guest of the New Forest committee. Not only did that allow me to find out at first hand about some of the important issues in the forest, but it gave me an opportunity to talk to many people with a variety of views about the best way forward. Indeed, following encouragement by hon. Members, including the two hon. Gentlemen who represent the New Forest, I am hoping to revisit the forest soon, to see some of the areas that I was unable to see during my short visit. I have held separate meetings with a wide range of interested parties, including both hon. Gentlemen, representatives of the verderers, the Ramblers Association and the Council for the National Parks. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has also met with representatives of the New Forest committee and held discussions with a range of other interested parties. Yesterday, I was able to reply for the Government in a debate on possible national park status for the south downs called by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner). Possible solutions for the future management of the south downs are also dealt with in the Countryside Commission's advice to the Government on protected areas and so are ideas for the better protection and management of areas of outstanding natural beauty, of which there are 37 in England. Many of the matters that we have to consider in the Countryside Commission's advice are interrelated and we are looking at them as a whole. Decisions about the New Forest cannot sensibly be taken in isolation from the other issues dealt with in that advice. The Government want to make the right decisions on each of those matters, which is why we are taking some time to reach conclusions. We will do so as soon as possible. I can tell the House today that we are studying carefully the full range of options for the New Forest, which include the option of a national park designated under the 1949 Act, with a freestanding national park authority, with the revised responsibilities and powers provided for under the Environment Act 1995. That option was not available when the national parks review panel reported in 1991 or when the previous Government said in 1992 that they were going to pursue a tailor-made solution. However, we have not yet made up our minds. We are fully aware of the special factors operating in the New Forest, especially the responsibilities of the Forestry Commission and the verderers. After all, almost half of the area is managed on behalf of Ministers by the Forestry Commission. A national park authority in the New Forest would have to work closely with the Forestry Commission and the verderers. It would also need to have an appropriate relationship with the planning arrangements of the local authorities in the area. We are also aware that national park status would bring a number of benefits. Besides a 75 per cent. funding contribution from central Government, it would bring a statutory boundary, a recognised high planning status and well-understood powers and responsibilities. The 1995 Act provides for national park authorities to have duties both to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of their areas and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of their areas. In doing so, they have to seek to foster the economic and social well-being of local communities. Those are all duties that are highly relevant to the requirements of the New Forest. Whichever management solution is adopted for the New Forest, the question of defining a boundary will need to be resolved. There will be a mechanism to do that, whichever route we choose. I am also aware that a number of voices are in favour of a designation that goes wider than the heritage area. Those issues need to be considered in detail. The heritage area already covers about twice the area managed by the Forestry Commission. Within the Crown lands, the Forestry Commission has a highly regarded track record, reflecting the importance that the Commission attaches to its duty of care in the forest. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), who has responsibility for fisheries and the countryside, visited the New Forest in the summer to launch the consultation on a revision of the mandate under which the Forestry Commission-"];;neutral

1949-03-31a.1461.3.txt;;['I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second time." This long-awaited Bill will be received with great pleasure by a large number of people all over the country who have witnessed with considerable concern disturbing trends in the development of these islands. We are today one of the most densely populated countries in the world. More and more people are living in towns. Today four out of every five are living in urban communities, and this has resulted in almost a complete separation of town and country. There are almost two different peoples with differing mentalities with a lack of understanding by the townsmen of the countryman\'s point of view. In particular, there is a very considerable lack of knowledge and appreciation on the needs of the countryside and its preservation. Yet with the increasing nervous strain of life it makes it all the more necessary that we should be able to enjoy the peace and spiritual refreshment which only contact with nature can give. There is first of all the disfigurement of the countryside. This has been going on for 100 years or more. We have shacks, ribbon development, unsightly coastal development, mineral workings, quarrying, power stations, gas works, poles and pylons supporting overhead electricity, telegraph and telephone wires, radar and radio establishments, reservoirs, outdoor advertisements, nissen huts, hutments, hangars and other Service buildings. Each of these more or less necessary appurtenances of modern science, progress and civilisation makes a great contribution to the disfigurement of the countryside. Then we have suffered a considerable loss of agricultural land. This is of primary importance to us today in view of the economic situation, but it is not so much with that aspect of it that I want to deal this afternoon, but with the fact that agricultural land contributes very greatly through its pattern of cultivation to the unique character and the beauty of our landscape. It is from this loss that we are suffering now. In recent years there has been a considerable loss of access to the countryside through the ploughing up of footpaths during the war, land required by the Service Departments, gathering grounds and so on. Although owners of uncultivated land in various parts of the country have tacitly permitted trespass on their land, there are still many places where access is difficult, for instance, in the High Peak, where often the only contact with the lovely countryside is the remote one of being able to look at it from concrete or tarmacadamed roads, despite the fact that there are millions of people living in conditions of great congestion within 25 miles of the Peak district, whose only outlet to the countryside practically is in that area. Coupled with these trends is a considerable lack of public facilities for open-air recreation, and for opportunities of getting to the countryside and enjoying it. The Bill before the House is directed to arresting and reversing these various trends. Its objects broadly are, first, to preserve and enhance the beauty of the countryside; and, secondly, to enable our people to see it, get to it, and enjoy it. This Bill is the culmination of the pioneering efforts of many public spirited persons who devoted themselves to the open-air cause through the agency of voluntary organisations. Some of them were formed as far back as the second half of the last century. If I may, I should like to mention some of the names of these organisations, and in doing so I hope I am not leaving out any body which ought to be mentioned. There is the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society, the Ramblers\' Association, the Cyclists\' Touring Club, the Youth Hostels Association and many others. The results of their endeavours to interest and arouse public opinion have been slow but steady. Today, for example, there are, I understand, 150,000 registered ramblers, walkers, cyclists and climbers, and other similar organisations have large memberships. Youth hostels are being put up in increasing numbers all over the country. That is a very good sign. The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, was a landmark in the history of these movements. It went a long way to protecting the countryside in general and agriculture in particular from further arbitrary and unnecessary inroads. There is now effective control over general development. There are provisions relating to the preservation of trees and of buildings of historic and architectural interests. There is control over outdoor advertisements, and the Act provides for areas of special control in which there may not be any outdoor advertisements at all in the countryside. That is a great step forward. In addition, various efforts have been made in recent years to secure better access to the countryside for the public. The earliest attempt, so far as I have been able to trace it, was the unsuccessful Bill, Access to Mountains Bill, introduced by the late James Bryce in 1888. A later Measure, the Access to the Mountains Act, 1939, introduced by my right hon. Friend the Colonial Secretary, then Member for Shipley, met with a somewhat better fate. It passed into law in a very attenuated form-in such a form that it was regarded by the amenity societies as entirely unsatisfactory and unworkable. Indeed, one of the main planks in their programme in recent years has been the repeal of this Measure. The national parks movement in this country goes back about half a century, but after the First World War the conception of national parks made more rapid strides. In 1930 the Government set up a committee to explore the question of national parks under the chairmanship of Lord Addison. This committee reported in 1931 at a moment when it was somewhat inauspicious for embarking on ventures of this kind. Sir Leslie Scott, as Chairman of the Scott Committee, made a number of valuable recommendations regarding national parks in his report in 1942, but quite naturally no action was taken during the war. In 1945, the late Mr. John Dower issued a report on national parks in England and Wales. He was a great champion of the open air, and it is a source of deep regret to us all that he has not survived to see the fruition of his efforts; but his work lives. In 1947, we had a series of reports, published under the chairmanship of Sir Arthur Hobhouse. He published three reports, one on national parks, one on footpaths and access to the countryside, and one on wild life conservation. I should like to express my own great indebtedness and that of the whole community, to Sir Arthur Hobhouse and to his committee for the very valuable reports which they published. These reports are informative and stimulating and they have had a very great influence in the preparation of the Measure today. May I say also, in all fairness, that the House is indebted to my predecessor the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. W. S. Morrison), for having appointed the late Mr. John Dower and the Hobhouse Committee who produced these very valuable documents? The Government have accepted the Hob-house reports as to some 90 per cent. I should like to say to Sir Arthur Hobhouse that that is not bad going and that very few chairmen of committees have had the satisfaction of seeing their reports implemented within so short a time and to such a considerable extent. The Government have accepted the policy of creating a number of national parks in this country. The first two parts of the Bill provide the necessary machinery and powers. At this stage, I should like to explain to the House the conception of a national park as applied to this country. The term "park" is misleading. Some hon. Members later in the Debate may even say that the term "national" is misleading, but we shall deal with that when we come to it. The term "park" in the Oxford Dictionary is defined as a large, enclosed piece of ground, usually with woodland and pasture, attached to a country house or devoted to public use; an enclosure in a town ornamentally laid out for public recreation. Of course, the national park is neither of those. The national park is defined in the Bill, both implicitly and explicitly, as an extensive area of outstanding beauty, suitable for open air recreation by the general public, but where the normal life of the existing community goes on. Such an area may run into hundreds of square miles. The largest of those that we propose is more than 800 square miles in area. There are national parks in a great many countries throughout the world. The earliest of them to be created was in 1872 in the United States of America. There must be a number of hon. Members who have been to Yellowstone Park, which is, indeed, a very great inspiration. It was followed by a great number of similar national parks throughout the United States of America, owned either by the Federal Government or, in a number of cases, by State Governments. There are a great number of national parks in other parts of the world. For instance, Canada has 26, South Africa, Australia and the Belgian Congo have parks, and New Zealand has 10. There are other parks in places like Kenya and Eire, and in many European countries. Generally speaking, those parks differ in a number of respects from what is proposed in this country. Many of those national parks have, for one of their purposes, the preservation of wild life or of flora and fauna. They are, in fact, to a considerable degree, large nature or game reserves. For instance, Yellowstone Park has a very large number of wild bears and other specimens of wild life which the public are recommended not to tease or to get into too close contact with. It has an area of 3,471 square miles, which is about four times the area of the largest of the proposed national parks, the Lake District. Nevertheless, it contains a number of features which are of interest and value to us in this country, and many of the facilities for recreation in Yellowstone Park and other national parks throughout the world will, it is hoped, be provided in our own national parks. They have hiking, fishing, boating, swimming, riding, motorbus tours, museums and information facilities. They have accommodation in the way of camping sites and tents and cabins that can be hired, and they have hotels, lodgings and refreshment houses distributed all over the area. The most fundamental difference from our proposed national parks is that it is essential, and I think very desirable too, that in our national parks the ordinary rural life, such as farming, rural industry and afforestation, should continue to function. This is a small country, and we cannot afford, as can the United States, to set aside large areas solely for the purpose of public recreation or establishing a museum. National park areas such as are proposed in the Hobhouse Report represent no less than 10 per cent. of the total area of England and Wales. The conservation areas, some 52, that are recommended in the Hobhouse Report, account for another 15 per cent., so that the acceptance of the reports on both national parks and conservation areas will involve 25 per cent. of the area of this country. We have to be extremely careful how far we sterlise an area of that size. Those areas must be used to maintain the economic life of the community. It may be inevitable that different uses of land should exist cheek by jowl. I have been severely criticised, particularly by the hon. Member for the High Peak (Mr. Molson), for permitting a limited extension of a cement works in the Peak district, but the hon. Gentleman would not hesitate to attack me on the following day for the non-provision of houses. Cement is one of the necessary ingredients for houses. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways; or perhaps, as a Member of the Opposition, he can; but I cannot have it both ways. If we stop the production of cement we are automatically stopping the production of those items and articles from which cement is made. Just as all life is dynamic and circumstances and conditions change, so must we be prepared for necessary and inevitable changes in our national parks. Any other outlook would be fatal to the success of the national parks themselves. Among other changes, there may be a need for further afforestation, and there will be discussions between the Forestry Commission and the National Parks Commission before it takes place. Other forms of development may also be necessary. The Bill does, however, recognise the special position of agriculture and forestry. In Clause 4 (5) it provides that both the National Parks Commission and the local authorities are to have due regard to the need for securing that agriculture and forestry as established in the parks shall be efficiently maintained. Here I should like to make it quite clear that the closest consultation will take place between my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture and myself on any proposals affecting land used for agriculture whether in a proposed national park or in an area of open country to which the public is to have access or on the creation of a new public right of way. Indeed, this is merely perpetuating the existing practice, but I think it right to place on record that these consultations will take place. Incidentally, I hope that the national parks as well as the areas of exceptional beauty will be well signposted, and that, while I do not visualise anything in the nature of a physical fence running round them, the public will nevertheless be informed when coming into a national park or an area of exceptional beauty-and when they are actually in such an area-and will learn to take a pride in it and feel that it belongs to them. I shall now briefly describe the proposals in the Bill for national parks. The proposals are contained in Parts I and II. It is proposed to set up a National Parks Commission. This will consist of a chairman, a deputy chairman and a number of members. The Bill does not prescribe the number of members. I think that we should probably begin with a small number and increase them as the number of national parks and areas of exceptional beauty increases. It would be a mistake to appoint a large number of people at the beginning without giving them an adequate amount of work to do. It is proposed that the chairman, the deputy chairman and the members should all serve part-time and that only the chairman and the deputy chairman should be paid. As regards the membership, no particular qualifications are mentioned in the Bill, but I have in mind that they should be persons with a love of the countryside and with a knowledge and understanding of open-air life and needs for recreation. I should like to see on such a Commission somebody with considerable experience in the provision of recreational facilities.'];;neutral
1966-12-14a.466.2.txt;;['I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the speedy removal of slagheaps, and for connected purposes. I believe that the Bill which I seek leave to introduce will receive consideration from hon. Members on both sides, because it is a matter of urgency and moment. When I tabled the Bill, last July, I do not think that anyone in the House or in the country could conceive the scale of the recent tragedy that would so poignantly underline the need for such a Bill. For far too long we have tolerated the ugliness, the squalor and the danger of man-made dereliction. We stand condemned by our failure in this matter. For far too long we have stood supinely by while large pants of our "green and pleasant land" are transformed into areas that are anything but green and certainly not pleasant. It is profitless to apportion blame. The coal and steel and gravel companies, the many local authorities, Governments of all political persuasions, all must bear some responsibility. What, surely, we have to do now is to so organise ourselves nationally that a determined effort can be made and sustained over the next few years to eradicate these symptoms of past neglect. The present situation is that local authorities have a general responsibility for treating derelict land and an Exchequer contribution in the form of a grant is available in certain areas and subject to certain conditions. Derelict land, for this purpose, is defined as land which has been so damaged by industrial or other development that it is incapable of beneficial use without treatment. Examples include disused spoil and slag-heaps, worked-out mineral excavations, and abandoned industrial installations. However, land that is still in active use does not qualify-for example, a spoil heap on which tipping is taking place. The size of the problem is immense. According to the surveys carried out by local land authorities for the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, in England, at the end of last year, there were 91,000 acres of derelict land, of which 54,000 acres justified treatment. In 1965, about 4,500 acres were reclaimed for landscape. In Wales, the problem is relatively much worse-16,500 acres of derelict land, nearly 10,000 acres justifying treatment and only 330 acres treated in 1965. These figures exclude tips and excavations that are still in use, which would nearly double the figures. Thus, it would take over 30 years to deal with the problem in Wales and 12 years to deal with the problem in England. These, frankly, must be optimistic figures, because inevitably the most easily cleared derelictions are being dealt with first. The new Local Government Bill provides for a national derelict land grant of 50 per cent. of approved expenditure with no geographical restriction or industrial criterion. It would be churlish to cavil at such an improvement, but I do not think that it meets the basic objection that many small local authorities, particularly in South Wales and the North of England, and possibly in Cornwall, just do not have the financial resources to meet even 10 or 15 per cent. of the cost, much less 50 per cent. This problem has been with us for far too long, but this does have one benefit which makes the task of cleaning up the countryside much easier than would have been possible even 15 years ago. For example, the ironstone workings in the Midlands can now be reclaimed for farming because of improvements in modern machinery, while the pioneer work of the National Coal Board and the Civic Trust has enabled the transplating of mature trees up to 60 ft. high. At Bickershaw, near Wigan, an old spoil heap has been turned into experimental plots for the establishment of grassland, and this has demonstrated that good grazing can be established on colliery shale at costs not very much greater than ordinary grassland conversion. Thus, technologically I believe that we are now well capable of dealing with spoil and slag heaps, disused quarries and workings, but this is useless unless there is the will, the administrative framework, and the money to carry out this transformation. That there is a national will to tackle this problem urgently, there can be no doubt. My Bill would deal with the two other essentials: the administrative framework and money. The present system of many local authorities, aided by Exchequer grants, is operating on too small and limited a scale to do anything but nibble at this problem. My Bill would propose the establishment of a National Land Improvement Agency whose sole task would be to turn our derelict and blighted countryside into safe areas that can be real amenities to their local communities. They would draw up an action programme which would be based on the survey of derelict land already being carried out. Slag and spoil heaps, quarries, excavations and other man-made blots on the countryside would be listed in three categories. First, those that are an exising or potential danger to human or animal life. Secondly, those that are not dangerous, but affect the amenities of the district. Thirdly, those that are not dangerous and have little effect on the amenities of a district. A 10-year programme would be drawn up concentrating as a crash priority on the first category, namely, those derelictions that are dangerous. The second category would also be dealt with, and the aim would be to have cleared both categories at the end of the 10 years. The agency would work in close conjunction with local authorities, the National Coal Board, quarry owners, the Forestry Commission, the Civic Trust, and other relevant bodies. The agency would have to have powers of compulsory acquisition for certain circumstances, and it would certainly need a highly competent staff to investigate and supervise the work of reclamation. It would also need money-quite a lot of money. The "Countryside in 1970" conference, last year, estimated the cost of clearing the 100,000 acres of dereliction at GBP 50 million. This is about the cost in one year of abolishing prescription charges, or the cost of two new Type 81 frigates. The benefits which would ensue would far, far outweigh this expenditure. In terms of human life alone the expenditure would be amply justified. There would be no more living in fear under the shadow of spoil heaps, no more sorry tales of children being drowned in disused and unprotected gravel quarries. In terms of comfort and amenity, the dividends from such an investment would be incalculable. New playing fields, grassy parks, fertile allotments, inland boating centres, could all be created from the present decay and desolation. I believe that it is no coincidence that the regional problems of unemployment, slums, and bad health are greatest in those areas where there is the greatest dereliction. The recent tragedy in South Wales has moved the country to both unprecedented grief and generosity. The best tribute we can pay to those who lost their lives is to ensure that the money and administrative organisation is available and set up so that the next generation\'s contact with dereliction and spoil heaps will be confined to fading newsreels and history books. It is in this spirit that I hope hon. Members will grant me leave to submit my Bill to the House.'];;neutral
1975-06-11a.621.4.txt;;['At the start of the debate, although questionably in order, I hope that I may ask the Minister whether the Department will consider the urgent need for a worthy British Embassy in Brasilia, in that splendid and challenging country, where we were the first to acquire a site but are one of the last to provide an effective embassy. I hope that it will be British in character but using exciting Brazilian materials and local craftsmanship.

Architectural Heritage Year Europe has resulted, in the United Kingdom and in Europe, in much that is excellent and first class. I would be the first to pay a generous tribute to the successes of this venture-successes which have been achieved and which are yet to come. However, there is so much that is wrong in these matters and there are so many fears held by so many people. I am informed by an organisation called "Save the National Heritage"-"Save is its key word-that 620 listed buildings had been the subjects of applications for demolition until May of this year. That is surely a distressing state of affairs. Today has seen the publication of a forceful and formidable book entitled "The Rape of Britain". It is written by Mr. Colin Amery and Mr. Dan Cruickshank, both of whom are on the committee of "Save". Valuable publicity is given in it and a great number of cases which are worth considering. I thought that I was fortunate in having an advance copy of this book, but I see that the Daily Mirror has also received one, and that Mr. Waterhouse, who is a most cogent writer, has devoted the whole of the centre pages to a review. He draws attention to many of the things in it, and I should like to do so, too. The Poet Laureate has written a foreword in which he says This is a devastating book. In my mind\'s ear I can hear the smooth tones of the committee man explaining why the roads must go where they do regardless of the humble old town they bisect. In my mind\'s eye I can see the swish perspective tricked up by the architect\'s firm to dazzle the local councillors. I see the tailored models walking past the plate glass, bent forward against a strong breeze. Round the corner I see senior citizens and youth representatives sipping Cinzano under a striped umbrella in the hot sunshine which always lends a Costa Brava look to architectural drawings. I hear words like \'complex\', \'conurbation\', \'precinct\', pedestrianisation\' and that other couple of words which mean total destruction, \'comprehensive development\'. Places cease to have names, they become areas with a number. Houses become housing, human scale is abandoned. We must put in something to please these tiresome people, the preservationists, and so we will leave, shorn of its suroundings, a Georgian building which has been praised in a guide book". It is true that some people regard some of the Poet Laureate\'s particular fancies as being an expression of a dotty devotion to all things past, but I do not share that point of view. The worthy Sir John has often had to overstate the case to get anybody to listen to him. The book is dramatic in its method of presentation. It gives examples of what has happened to the city of Gloucester, where I spent some of my earliest days. Almost all of it is gone except for the cathedral precinct. I have represented the city of Bristol as councillor and Member of this House for 21 years. There we have lost more since the war than the Germans destroyed by bombing. We have had our successes, but it has been a hard job, and one must be ever vigilant. We have fought off threats to the Avon Gorge and we have saved Ashton Court-at the eleventh hour-and Kings Weston, although the garden buildings are in ruins. The city docks are not to be filled in. There has been much good restoration work in Clifton, and Montpelier and St. Pauls would have been wiped out had not the citizens protested and the planners relented. There are lessons here, particularly concerning the growing influence of local amenity societies. There is one, in every ward of my constituency, doing splendid work. Some of them came on the scene a little too late and we lost a great deal. In Newcastle there has been the celebrated case of Eldon Square. What happened there must never be allowed to happen again. In Salisbury, not far from my home, a great deal is being torn down but the traffic is being diverted not very far from the city centre. We all know about the situation in Bath. You, Mr. Deputy Speaker, know all about Cardiff, although I gather that Llandaff, that historic place where I was born, is so far untouched by developers. However, the constituencies of your parliamentary colleagues are threatened with one kind of "improvement" or another. What is to be done? Obviously publicity in advance of irrevocable decisions is eminently desirable. The conservation societies are doing a splendid job and should be encouraged in every possible way. If local authorities are not carrying out their statutory duties in taking note of what local people feel, as expressed in individual letters, or representations from Members of Parliament because their constituents have approached them, or of what the societies say as a body, I hope that the Minister will at least say that he will twist their arms, or whatever the appropriate phrase is, by means of a circular or something more severe should that be necessary. I hope he will ensure that local authorities are aware of the need to take local people into their confidence at the earliest possible moment. That is not to say that the amenity societies should not be told, fair and square, that they are expected to come forward with imaginative and constructive proposals. There have been societies in the past which have simply opposed every single thing suggested by a local authority, thinking that that was their duty. Far from it. This is a two-way operation. At the national level no one can deny that the amenity societies are highly responsible bodies which often produce constructive and imaginative solutions to problems about which officialdom had not thought. The local societies are growing in calibre. If they are given the right encouragement they will continue to improve. What of the future? How can we keep up the impetus we have achieved as a result of Heritage Year? There is a sad lesson to be learned from the "Plant a Tree" campaign of 1973. By 1974&#8211;75 we had the capital transfer tax and the wealth tax proposals, which have certainly killed much of the activity in private forestry, which provides the trees that are admired by future generations. The attitude of the Forestry Commission, the official Government agency, is leading to the planting of what lay people call Christmas trees-coniferous forests, which are not so attractive as the hard woods grown on private estates. I must not digress too far, but while I am on the subject of trees I will say that one owner of a great estate calculated that the only way in which he could pay the wealth tax for one year on his estate was to cut down a three-mile avenue of oaks that had taken 200 years to grow. I know that the Chancellor is paying close attention to this and will carefully examine the report of the Select Committee dealing with the subject. I hope to have a certain amount to do with that. There are other celebrated cases on which the Minister may be able to comment. There is the case of the sewage farm that threatens Audley End Park. Is he happy about that? What about the motorway that threatens to destroy Petworth Park, or the controversial road proposal, about which we have heard much in The Times, affecting Chilston Park? Are we to take heart over the victory at Levens Park-a victory achieved only after constructive public outcry? We had the sad loss of Saltram Park, where the road carved right through the landscape. There is Conway Castle, and the horrifying bridge which will dwarf all the other structures. Is that inevitable? I put it to the Minister that many of the landscapes to which I have referred are irreplaceable. At any rate, it would take a couple of centuries of devoted work to create anything like them again, even if the resources and the location were available. I do not want to be unkind, but I feel that even with a sustained effort over two centuries the municipal parks departments of our great boroughs would probably not be able to do as well as Mr. Capability Brown or Mr. Repton with a private patron behind him. It is not their sphere. We are making mistakes-every generation will make mistakes-and we are still losing so much, and things are not going in the right direction. Recently they have tended to take a positive turn in the wrong direction, despite considerable penalties for attacking fine buildings, and despite considerable Government interest, not with enormous financial backing but with an increasing amount of resources available to the Historic Buildings Council which is a Government agency. I must be delicate here, because I am a member of it and do not wish to say things that I should not. One thing which might help to move things back in the right direction would be to make it advantageous to people to take an interest in the fine buildings they may happen to own, or seek to own, by giving them a tax advantage. I must not talk about legislation, but the Minister may consider a proposal along that line to give a worthwhile incentive so that people would seek out historic buildings as a form of tax haven. There was a public exchange-which has been printed-between the Select Committee dealing with the wealth tax and the Inland Revenue. The Revenue was asked whether it was immoral for people to put money into historic buildings instead of allowing the Revenue to collect it in taxes. Even the Revenue had to admit that tax evasion or avoidance in favour of historic buildings was a social plus. I hope that the Minister will consider that suggestion. The Minister with responsibility for the arts is to publish shortly a glossy booklet on what I suppose he would call the achievements of the Government, to be entitled "Arts and the People". We await that booklet with great interest. How about a Department of the Environment booklet entitled "Architecture and the People"? I am sure that there is no authoritative document which brings together all the useful information required by people who are anxious to help with the restoration and enhancement of the nation architectural heritage. There is no good guide book on this subject. I hope that the Minister will consider that suggestion. It might even give a little more information about the splendid work of the historic buildings councils, although I blush to mention it. The councils are doing their best, and have done over many years, with limited resources. As I draw to a close I shall say a word or two about our own back-yard, that is, Parliament and the parliamentary precincts. We have stuck to our fine old palace and in many ways enhanced it recently. We have tried to make it look more attractive and to restore it to something like its original condition. In some places we have successfully adapted it. The only real "monster" is Star Court, but we all know that that was run up during the holidays by an enthusiastic Minister of Works who was determined to provide an office or two. I shall not pursue that matter further. Norman Shaw North has been rescued from destruction, I would claim, by the House of Commons insisting on having it as an office building. It is a fine building and the Department has made a good job of putting it in order for us at far less cost than a new building. What about the Bridge Street site? Are we to proceed with the Spence and Webster proposed new parliamentary building? Has the Minister any estimate of the cost of that building with all the supporting services? Are we to consider keeping Norman Shaw South as well as the north block and the Whitehall Club, and perhaps putting on the rest of the site a well-mannered stone building which need not be built all at once but built as a gradual progression-a building which would not overshadow this fine building on this side of the street? Surely Bridge Street is an important site in London on which we do not want any architect to show off. It should not be used for a building that shows off but for a building that fits in with its more important and significant neighbours. I believe that we could consider a new idea for the site in that it could be linked with this palace at principal floor level. I shall not go into that matter in detail lest every architectural pundit in the country reaches for his pen and writes to all the national newspapers and we go off on some red herring which distracts from the main theme of the argument. However, if we had a link with principal floor level the building would not be a lost soul; it would be part of the palace and would provide valuable additional accommodation. The link would also serve to obscure some of the view from Parliament Square across the bridge to some of the rubbish on the other side. I mean not County Hall but the absolutely faceless other buildings which will be there for a long time. And looking from the other side of Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square one sees the sides of some appalling buildings. Perhaps the sort of link I have mentioned would be a positive improvement. As for the traffic in Parliament Square, I hope we shall get rid of that by the end of the century. What about the Foreign Office? How many of the fine rooms will be retained? What about the courtyard? Are we to roof it over and save the interior walls and the statues, and avoid any destruction? I now turn to the question of building materials. In Architectural Heritage Year are we to see the run-down of Bath and Portland Stone firms, for example, and the loss of skilled craftsmen? I have spoken before about this matter and have written to the Secretary of State about it. It was one of Sir Christopher Wren\'s principles that when sufficient funds were not available for the elaboration of the whole of a design, some one or more important features should be worked up to a higher ideal than the rest, instead of adopting a lower standard for the whole". Is there not an element of truth in that principle for our times? We could put fine stone features into our buildings that are otherwise dull and functional. What about stone for restoration work? Much could be ordered in advance of building work and lie to mature, like good wine in the yards. I return to Sir Christopher Wren. In the last Parliament of William III, Christopher Wren, Knight, was a member of this House for Melcombe Regis, in Dorset. That is within walking distance of the Portland stone quarries which are now somewhat depressed. I believe that it is said that St. Pauls was built of Portland Stone because of Wren\'s constituency interest. That is not true. Portland stone was used because it is the best stone in the world. Sir Christopher Wren would have spoken with more eloquence than I about the millions of cubic metres of concrete now being poured into public buildings where good stone could delight the eye of succeeding generations. Sir Christopher richly deserved the inscription in St. Pauls-"Si momumentum reauiris, rircumspice". Are the Government happy with what they see when they look around at our threatened or vanishing architectural heritage? Certainly the Government have no reason to be complacent. Architectural Heritage Year is an awakening of interest. We cannot afford now to go to sleep. I hope that the Government will from now on show more energy and imagination in working towards the rescue and enhancement of that Britain we know and hope to keep.'];;negative
1981-07-31a.1443.0.txt;;['I appreciate the concern that my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) has expressed. As we all know, he is extremely assiduous in meeting the needs and requirements of his constituents, and it is right that he should have taken this opportunity to raise the matter in this debate. I welcome this opportunity to speak about opencast coal mining in the Forest of Dean and, in particular, the Cannop valley. When I refer to the Forest of Dean in this context, I mean the forest itself, as administered by the Forestry Commission, and not the district of the same name. I shall deal first with the Cannop valley before considering the broader context of the forest. The surface area of the valley has not previously been affected by mineral workings. The coal seams in the vicinity of Cannop ponds cover an area of some 90 hectares, about three-quarters of which is covered with conifers planted about 1972. The balance of the area features oak about 150 years of age, much of which traverses the area in three broad strips. The total reserves of coal in the area are said to be about 1 million tonnes. The private company that now owns several of the seams purchased them from a company that was granted planning permission for test drilling in 1979. But before coal extraction could take place a further planning permission would have to be obtained. I am unaware of any application for opencast mining relating to the Cannop area. Unlike an application from the National Coal Board-which would be made to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy-an application from a private operator would be made to the county council as the appropriate local planning authority. Thus, in the first instance, the decision would be taken by councillors. This, of course, means that local people and interests would be able to inject their views into the debate. No doubt the planning authority would consider the possible impact on the local environment. I am sure, too, that the Forestry Commission would be consulted. There is no question of a decision being taken in advance of considerable local discussion. Even if planning permission were granted, the applicant could not begin extraction immediately. First, the operator would have to obtain a lease of the land from the Forestry Commission, which would first refer the case to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in whom responsibility for the Forest of Dean is vested. If my right hon. Friend agreed in principle that the commission should grant a lease for mining, the commission would negotiate the conditions with the company after taking account of local views. It is likely that, as was the case at Woorgreens-which I shall mention later-the commission would be closely involved in the detailed restoration plans for the site. The possibility of opencast operations in the Cannop valley depends on many factors. It may be that no development will take place, but if it does it will have to take account of all the factors. I assure my hon. Friend that I have taken note of the concern he has expressed on behalf of his constituents in the area and that we shall study and bear in mind all that he has said. The planning policies of the area will soon be governed by the Gloucestershire structure plan, which was submitted to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in March 1980. It included a policy relating to opencast coal mining in the Forest of Dean. That policy was among the matters selected for discussion at the examination in public of the plan that took place in September 1980. Local interests were represented at the examination, as were the Department of Energy, the National Coal Board and the Forestry Commission. Following the examination, my right hon. Friend published in June his proposals to modify a number of policies in the plan. They took account of the report of the panel that conducted the examination. Among the proposed modifications was one designed to make the policy relating to opencast mining less restrictive and to permit opencast mining, subject-and I emphasise this-to certain conditions. They were that the land was improved as a result of the operations and that there were no serious conflicts with amenity considerations. As my hon. Friend has said, the proposed modification has given rise to a significant number of objections which we are considering prior to the approval of the plan. We are concerned with how we make the best use of our resources. As is frequently the case, we have to take a number of conflicting factors into account before reaching any conclusion as to what our policy should be. The conflicting factors in this instance can be summarised as the need to be able to extract coal should it be required; the need to improve land for forestry and agriculture when it can be justified; and the need to protect the countryside as a natural habitat of wildlife and as a place of recreation and enjoyment. I noted what my hon. Friend said about the welcome that visitors receive in the forest and about the importance of tourism to the area\'s economy. Our island has been blessed with coal, but we can work it only where it can be found. It would be highly imprudent of us, in the light of the uncertainty surrounding future energy supplies as a whole, to overlook the potential contribution that any source of energy may make, even if, at the end of the day, it is decided not to develop it. The National Coal Board is seeking to maintain a level of opencast production of at least 15 million tonnes per annum. That level of production was called for by the board\'s "Plan for Coal" and confirmed in 1974, and "Coal for the Future" published in 1977. As I understand the position, the board has no plans for opencast production in the Forest of Dean at present, although there may be a need for the coal at some time in the future. As will be clear from my earlier remarks, however, we are not concerned only with opencast mining by the National Coal Board. The Forest of Dean, which has great traditions, which I am pleased to acknowledge, is unique in that most of the coal seams are privately owned. In the 1950s and early 1960s a number of planning permissions were given for the opencast extraction of coal in the forest and the surrounding area. Within the Dean forest park there are no current permisions that have not been taken up. In order to get the topic we are debating in focus, I would add that the Forest of Dean, which is about 10,000 hectares in extent, is thought to have about 400 hectares of potential land for opencast working-only 4 per cent. of the total. The 400 hectares tend, however, to lie in the centre of the forest. They are concentrated in four or five sites. I do not think there is any disagreement between myself and my hon. Friend that there are parts of the forest that have been badly damaged by mineral working in the past. There is scope in such areas to improve the land to make it more suitable for forestry or agriculture. The degree of improvement that follows from a scheme for restoration can be measured only over a period of years, but there are examples throughout the country where restoration following opencast mining has been successful. A good example of that has been at Woorgreens in the forest where about 54 hectares of poor quality forestry land-which included more than 95 per cent. of conifers-has been considerably improved after opencast extraction of about 244,000 tonnes of coal. Indeed, experience on the site in the planting years 1979&#8211;80 and 1980&#8211;81 has indicated better growth and survival on the opencast site than on normal clear fell sites. The restoration of the site has permitted the inclusion of more oaks than would previously have been feasible. Therefore, in the long term, opencast coal mining need not be all bad. It can enable us to develop one of our natural resources and, by means of restoration, lead in some cases to better soil conditions. But it can, of course, also seriously conflict with the protection of our natural environment. As a veteran of lengthy debates on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill, I am only too well away of the depth of feeling rightly held by many people. In an area such as the Forest of Dean and, in particular, the Dean forest park, which is intended to provide a centre for recreation and enjoyment of the countryside, those environmental considerations assume a particular significance. That makes it all the more important that, if any future workings were to be authorised, any nuisance such as noise and dust should be kept to a minimum. It is important, too, that conditions are imposed to ensure thin the landscape suffers no long-term ill effects. However, it is worth noting that during the working at Woorgreens few environmental problems were encountered. It is clear from what my hon. Friend has said, and from the objections we have received in connection with the proposed modifications to the structure plan, that many people are concerned with the potential damage to the natural environment and amenities in the forest. I assure my hon. Friend that, although I cannot anticipate whatever policy on this subject in the structure plan will finally be approved, some reference will be made to the need for any proposals to avoid serious conflict with amenity considerations.'];;neutral
1987-04-23a.826.0.txt;;['The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) must have got out of bed on the wrong side this morning. Even when he seemed able to support what the Government are doing, he seemed unable to do so with any grace. That is uncharacteristic of him and I am sorry to have heard it. However, I heard a little more about the alliance\'s two-tier policy that seems to be in existence, even if in a somewhat changed form. No doubt there is one tier for the Liberals and one for the SDP. I want to say a few things about the EEC proposals. It is not trivial to say that if I drop them on your toes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you would be right to complain. Cannot the EEC, or whoever is responsible for producing the English translation, produce the proposals in a form that we can more readily assimilate? The proposals form a considerable bundle and are extremely difficult to interpret. I should like to express my support for all that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has done in the negotiations. He is aiming at the right objectives and trying to achieve the targets that we all wish to achieve, although he cannot expect, and does not always receive, the success that he should. The churlishness expressed by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland will neither encourage our agriculture nor help my right hon. Friend to get a better deal in Europe. I hope that he will continue his strong approach to obtaining a green pound devaluation such as has been mentioned, and for which there is unanimous support. I hope also that he will try to do more to obtain the leasing of quotas, which I understand his Ministry has rejected and has informed the Milk Marketing Board that the EEC cannot support it. However, it has some potential use and I hope that he will continue to explore it in his negotiations. I should like to make two general points about agriculture. The first relates to selling. For many years producers have produced, but not many of them in agriculture have had to sell their products. Extraordinarily, by comparison with other industries, fewer of those engaged in agriculture have exercised any influence over their own market place. Perhaps that, is why those who produce and sell have not been seen as part of one process. The CAP has encouraged over-production, partly because of the divorce of production from selling. The Food from Britain campaign is a small start, but as yet it has not made nearly enough impact. I should like to draw two examples to the attention of my right hon. Friend. The first is the sale of 76,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter. As the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) has stated, New Zealand has no right to sell that butter. I am glad to see my right hon. Friend in his place but sorry to see that he is injured. I trust that it did not happen in any negotiations. I suspect that it was probably in one of the debates of the General Synod. We must do everything that we can to stop him enjoying any laughter, or he may do himself more injury. He made the point that New Zealand exporters have no right to sell butter here; they have an opportunity to do so, but no one is obliged to buy. However, they do. Paragraph 15 of the report that has just been produced by the Agriculture Select Committee states that the United Kingdom dairy trade would serve our farmers better if it learnt to market its products as well as the Dutch, Danish or New Zealand exporters. The second example of salesmanship that I wish to draw to the attention of my right hon. Friend is the sale of meat in the United Kingdom. During the past 20 years, although the overall consumption of meat has stood still in the United Kingdom, in the EEC as a whole meat consumption has increased by 37 per cent. At the same time, in the United Kingdom there has been a threefold increase in the consumption of poultry and a 13 per cent. decline in the consumption of other meats on a per capita basis. Therefore, I suggest that a good job is not being done in the promotion and sale of meat in the United Kingdom. I draw my right hon. Friend\'s attention to the fact that poultry, which is clearly being successfully promoted, is handled by private companies, whereas beef, lamb and pigmeat promotion is handled by the Meat and Livestock Commission. The M LC is not accountable to its producers, and a number of producers are not satisfied with its performance. I have no doubt that it needs more time to achieve more, and I also have no doubt that its resources are limited. Two points must be addressed right now. First, the case must be made for meat as against other foods. It is extraordinary that people can sell sweets and confectionery in Britain, which must, on health grounds, compare unfavourably with meat, and that they can get away with selling those goods as though they were somehow healthy or good for us. Secondly, we must consider splitting up the activities of the Meat and Livestock Commission so that pig producers especially can more closely control the promotion of pigmeat. Other sectors of the meat industry could do the same. My second general point relates to timber and to the case for an extended forestry industry. Sometimes the environmentalists, of whom I count myself one, seem to forget that the ancient woodlands that we wish to preserve once covered most of Britain. Undoubtedly, our lower-lying land could take more trees, and the need for diversification by farmers can encourage the creation of new woodlands. The Government are right to encourage that in the face of the EEC surpluses. The conservation aspects can be respected, but there must be a balance. The owner of one estate in my constituency is fond of telling me the story of a piece of ground that he took members of one august and respected conservation body to see 20 years ago when it was an arable field. He said, "You will be pleased to know that I am going to plant trees in this field because they will improve the look of the countryside. I am going into the timber industry." They replied, "You must not do that. If you do, it will spoil the look of the down, the lie of the countryside will be affected injuriously and it will not look so pretty." Nevertheless, he went ahead; and 20 years later he took another group from the same body devoted to rural England, of which I am a member, and said, "This wood has been planted for 20 years. You will be pleased to know that I propose to cut it down and restore the land to arable farming." He expected a chorus of huzzas, but they said, "You must not do that. If you do, you will destroy the way the landscape folds and the beautiful scenery. We hope you will not do that." Naturally he did. and the land is now in its former state. Well designed and managed forestry enhances conservation, not the reverse. We have too many unthinned plantations which are fit only for pulp and we have old-fashioned block plantations which will remain for many years as a reproach to our post-war foresters. The Forestry Commission has not always set the best example in caring for its woods, perhaps for short-term, financial, Government-imposed reasons. Forestry is a long business. In the United Kingdom the accent should be on first-class timber production, not on the production of wood for pulp. That inevitably means an emphasis on softwood timber. We cannot afford to overdo hardwoods for environmental reasons. Properly spaced trees and a good mix of hard and softwoods, by which I mean up to 75 per cent. of softwoods. which is certainly more than is set out in the consultative document, coupled with sensible thinning policies, can produce a good ecological background, bluebells galore and a viable business. I welcome the farm woodland scheme and shall comment on it, albeit two days after the end of the consultative period. I favour the first basis for the annual payment as it is administratively simpler and fairer nationally. I do not believe that an annual payment of GBP 125 per hectare will encourage farmers to make what is for many of them a radical change of business, even if they understand, which not many of them do, that that sum is on top of existing grants. The minimum 3 hectare area per holding should be lowered and the 1 hectare per individual block of woodland should also be reduced. The proportion of broadleaves proposed could be reduced to 25 per cent. in lowland areas. It is essential that good advice is available for farmers if they are to make the change that the Government are trying to encourage them to make. Clearly, the Forestry Commission is the body to monitor the schemes and the conditions imposed. If necessary, assistance in the form of advice should he provided as part of the scheme. I hope that sporting and leisure uses of woodland, which are important and greatly under-appreciated in towns and certainly in this House, will also be encouraged. I welcome the woodland scheme and the initiatives that my right hon. Friend the Minister is taking to lead our farmers to make changes which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Sir P. Mills) eloquently said, must be made if in future we are to have a viable, strong agriculture.'];;negative
1987-05-05a.701.4.txt;;['My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford has said that my argument and my facts are partly correct. My hon. Friend also raised the matter of lorry parking. No one wants unsuitable heavy vehicles stopping overnight in Bishop\'s Stortford or any other town or village nearby when it is possible for vehicles to be placed in lorry bays in an MSA. If the MSA is eventually situated at Birchanger, there should be an appropriate number of such bays. We have suggested to the operators that instead of the normal 50 bays there should be 85. That would allow greater control over lorries that might otherwise be placed in Bishop\'s Stortford. I hope that that will be some comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford and my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden. My hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden referred to the Department of Transport\'s forecasting. I have spent some time in industry and commerce. In every area in which I have worked, we have made forecasts. The Department of Transport makes its forecasts public. If we consider how our forecasts have stood up to events, we find that they have not done too badly. We were surprised in some places, and we have over-estimated the amount of traffic in some areas and under-estimated it in others. However, in general we do pretty well. We can hold our heads up among any set of forecasters. I have news for some of the pollsters who have been considering political affairs over the past few years. I suspect that some of their forecasts or polls have changed faster than the underlying views, although I suspect that they are becoming more accurate the nearer they get to the last year of this Parliament. I am grateful for the welcome that my hon. Friends have given to the Government\'s White Paper on roads, produced last week, which refers to trunking at least part of the A120. Trunking a road makes no significant difference to the amount of traffic. However, it makes a difference to the source of funding for improvements. One reason why there has been such a good welcome for the proposal from Essex and Hertfordshire is that the money will come directly from the taxpayer rather than from part-funding from the taxpayer and the ratepayer, as might otherwise have happened. It may also mean that other schemes that the councils have set their hearts upon may not have to be delayed by giving greater priority to the needs of the A120. I make that point because some of my constituents may read the reports of this debate. They saw the GLC spend a lot of money before its welcome abolition, claiming that as soon as the Department of Transport trunked a road, it automatically became a dual carriageway overnight. The truth is that 60 per cent. of our trunk roads are single carriageways and an awful lot of them will remain single carriageways. I am not offering that prospect for the A120, but I want people to know that trunking does not automatically lead to a massive increase in traffic or to major spending in the short term. We must use that quality to which my hon. Friends referred-common sense. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said in a television broadcast that was repeated on each channel this evening, common sense is basically Conservative policy. If we can mix that with giving people a democratic right to object to or oppose the Department\'s proposals, we are likely to make progress. Even if all people are not satisfied, they will know that they have at least had their day in court or that there has been a public inquiry at which they have been able to put their views. It may be worth reminding the House that it is our policy to provide MSAs at approximately 30-mile intervals at the moment so that the needs, comfort and safety of travellers can be catered for. Our present programme is to provide 20 new MSAs to fill gaps in the existing network, and on new motorways. The new sites will provide the standard range of facilities such as parking, toilets, refreshments, fuel and telephones 24 hours a day. We also look for the capacity to meet traffic demand well into the 21st century. To those who believe that people should not travel around by car, it is worth saying that there are 3 million provisional licence holders in this country, of whom 2 million are female. Therefore, instead of the car being the toy of the rich white male, there are a growing number of women driving, as well as a growing number of pensioners, and members of the ethnic minorities. As the Secretary of State said in a recent speech, it is just as important to cater for the needs of the person running a mark 1 Cortina in, say, Brixton as it is for the person running a new Montego in Watford. The MSA sites are necessary because, where such services are not available on the motorway, travellers will seek them in nearby communities, causing congestion and thus losing many of the benefits of the motorway. The MSA sites are selected by consultants\' study or other means, and account is taken of planning, environmental and traffic grounds, as well as costs and suitability. As my hon. Friend said, Birchanger was selected in 1980 after consultation with East Hertfordshire and Uttlesford district councils, and with Hertfordshire and Essex county councils. Alternatives were considered in other quadrants of the M11-A120 junction. We consider that the present site in the south-west quadrant is the best. It is near the mid-point of the M11, offers services to east-west traffic on the A120, and will provide back-up for the MSAs that are coming on the M25. Outline planning clearance was given in 1980 and renewed by all four interested local authorities in 1985. In 1985 they also had the opportunity to reconsider the proposal in relation to the decision on Stansted airport. Draft compulsory purchase orders for land acquisition for the MSA and the road diversion scheme were issued in January 1987. Twenty six objections were lodged, including one from my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford and another from East Hertfordshire district council, which agreed planning clearance in 1985 but has now revised its views. As I have said, an inquiry is considered appropriate and will be held later this year. Objectors will have ample opportunity to make their case, and to test that of the Department, before an independent inspector. All new MSA sites are carefully landscaped and screened by trees and other planting with bund walls-earth mounds-where appropriate to minimise environmental intrusion. At Birchanger, landscaping would be undertaken in and on the edge of the site to minimise visual and noise intrusion and light at night. From a visit that I paid, I seem to remember that the site lies in part at least, between the M11 and the golf course, on land that slopes down to the motorway, and that, in itself, will help screening. Investigations-by which I mean the use of my own eyes as well as of the advice that I am given-show no housing in the immediate area, and the golf course provides a buffer to the nearest housing concentration. Of course, the immediate area may be slightly more extensive to my hon. Friend than it is to myself. We take environmental issues seriously, which is one of the reasons why we produced our booklet on "Transport and the Environment", which will be welcomed by many of my hon Friends\' constituents. If they have not been able to get a copy, they should let me know and I shall happily send them one. It is something of which the Department can be proud. We do not claim that we have got everything right, but certainly during the past seven or eight years we have made dramatic improvements. There is not nearly as much controversy over roads and associated schemes as there was during the 1970s. We have learned, but I think that some of the objectors have learned also. People may often find that there are things for which they can argue if they have had the experience of reading "Transport and the Environment" and perhaps they can also give them more publicity. I am not suggesting that badger tunnels and toad holes are the answer to motorway service areas, but they show the breadth of our environmental concerns. It is worth noting that we are the largest planter of trees for amenity purposes in the country - second only to the Forestry Commission. I am grateful to my hon. Friends for raising the subject of the motorway service area. Obviously, the development of Stansted will bring some changes to the local area. There will be safe areas for foreseeable traffic demand both from the M11 and the A120, and we propose two accesses to the motorway service area. My hon. Friends rightly reflect some of the worries of their constituents. By the time the inquiry is completed, people will understand how well they are represented in the House and how far the Conservative party appears to have a monopoly of concern in this area.'];;neutral
1988-03-22a.332.2.txt;;['This is the first time that I have applied for an Adjournment debate, and I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me one immediately. I am particularly grateful to the Department of the Environment, from which I have received a speedier and greater level of co-operation in this matter than I have received from any Government Department on any issue since I was elected to this place. That co-operation has come from all concerned, from the Secretary of State downwards, and particularly from the Minister for Sport, who will reply to this debate, and those working in his private office, who have been working overtime on the urgent matter that I raise tonight. The House will be aware of the devastation which occurred in south-east England as a result of the storm. But some hon. Members may not be aware of an event which took place 11 days ago and which potentially in the long run could do more damage to the woodlands of England even than the storm. That event was a judgment in the Court of Appeal on two small woods, Quilters and Featherly, in my constituency, They are composed of sweet chestnuts which were planted certainly no later than 1600 and which lie next to a site of special scientific value. They are situated in a valley-in my view, the loveliest valley in east Kent -which has the rather evocative name of Pett Bottom. On March 11-I will not go through the chronology since the owner began trying to grub up the trees in these woods five years ago - a ruling was given that Canterbury council should pay almost GBP 50,000 in compensation to the owner of the woods so that they should be preserved from being ploughed up as farmland. Before going into the detail of this matter, it is worth considering why we should preserve woodland other than for commercial forestry. There are four additional reasons. The first is the landscape value, and these two woods are situated in one of the last three major areas of outstanding natural beauty left in the three south-east counties of Surrey, Sussex and Kent. The second is the amenity value for people who want to walk their dogs, take their kids for a picnic, or whatever. These woods have a perimeter path round them which makes them accessible to the public. The third is the ecological value which, for example, applies in shelter belts in protecting top soil. Finally, there is the wildlife aspect. All these are reasons why it is important to preserve woodland in the countryside. Let us consider what the judgment of 11 March means. It applies to all coppice woodland with a diameter at chest height of under 15 cm. It says that if any council anywhere chooses to slap a tree preservation order on a coppice to prevent its owner ploughing it up or using it for any other purpose not covered by the town and country planning Acts the council is bound to pay him the full difference between the value of the land for the purpose for which he wants to use it and its value as forestry. Perhaps I should explain that coppice has nothing to do with acreage or the species of tree involved; it is a form of forestry management. All coppice woods, if properly managed, are below the requisite size. Coppice woodlands are important in the country as a whole. They form quite a large proportion of our woodlands. They are important in the south-east counties. They are especially important in Kent where they form 60 per cent. of all the county\'s woodlands. Of course, there is a supreme irony in that the Farm Land and Rural Development Bill which is now in Committee is trying hard to divert land away from farming towards woodland because of the CAP. Yet as a result of this judgment owners will be entitled to convert woodlands back for "farming the CAP" or be compensated handsomely for not doing so. In other words, the wood owner can "farm the CAP" at the taxpayers\' expense with all the subsidies which are involved in farming today. The result is that developers are closing in. A developer who wants to buy a wood and plough it up for five times its value as a woodland knows that if a council steps in his way he can claim compensation. Unless there is rapid change, most councils will be unable to put on tree preservation orders to protect woodlands. Before suggesting a way forward, I should like to touch on the nature of tree preservation orders. They can involve single trees or woods. In the latter case, with which I am concerned, they involve a careful survey to determine exactly the extent of the trees on which the order is based and a fairly complicated legal process involving the sealing of documents, which takes time. The result is that the owner is prevented from destroying the trees. I say "destroying" because it is not only a case of felling them but of perhaps allowing animals to graze among them, which kills young trees. Tree preservation orders are not entirely negative. When a TPO is made, an owner is automatically put in touch with a considerable body of forestry expertise to enable him to understand how to look after the trees and at what point they are due for felling. In a coppice site in a typical period of 15 to 20 years a small proportion will need to be felled and replanted. The owner will also be advised on tree surgery. The only weakness of the TPO system is that it is cumbersome. When the Minister is considering the whole picture, he should think about extending the concept of the conservation area to cover woodlands. We have one small group of woods in my constituency protected in this way because they form part of an estate around a house, Broome park, which is designated a conservation area. What is the way forward? I stress that I am not trying to teach the Department of the Environment how to do its job, but I should like to make a couple of constructive suggestions as to what might be the best way to solve this serious and urgent problem. The first, and perhaps the simplest, option involves no change in the law. Article 5(b) of the tree preservation order says that there is no need for an authority to pay any compensation in the case of trees other than trees comprised in woodlands where the trees have an outstanding or special amenity value. The deletion of the words other than trees comprised in woodlands would go quite a long way to filling the loophole. The second option would be to allow the Forestry Commission to extend its felling licence requirements to cover trees far below the present diameter of 15 cm. I hope that you will forgive me Mr. Deputy Speaker; I realise that I am not supposed to call for a change in the law. However, I know that on Thursday my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir. J. Farr) hopes to table an amendment to the Farm Land and Rural Development Bill in Committee which would limit any possible compensation payments to the forestry value of the land, and thus effectively eliminate the problem from a financial angle. In summary, the test case was fought over two small and beautiful woods in a very beautiful valley, only about five miles from my home and in one of the last three remaining substantial areas of outstanding natural beauty in the south-east of England. The woods have been there for a least 400 years. To keep those two small woods, the council will have to pay almost GBP 50,000 in compensation. If that sum had not been arrived at in relation to the prices of several years ago, it would be much greater. Councils do not have that sort of money to throw around. Unless changes are made, every privately owned piece of coppice land in the country will be at risk - from a threat greater than the so-called hurricane. I stress again my gratitude for the tremendous cooperation of the Minister and his staff on this matter, and I look forward to hearing his response.'];;neutral
1991-04-18a.653.0.txt;;['I apologise for my husky voice. I have overused my vocal cords in the past couple of days in the cause of defeating the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill. I am sure that the Minister will be pleased to learn that I shall not speak for as long tonight! The hon. Members for Antrim, North (Rev Ian Paisley) and for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer) and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) paid special tribute to the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), who said that his speech tonight might be the last one that he would address to the House. Let me add my tributes to theirs. The hon. Member for Tiverton, with his hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Boscawen), has been a regular attender of our agriculture debates over recent years, and they have both contributed regularly. I have not always agreed with what they have said, but I have come to respect them as Members of Parliament who have served the House with diligence and loyalty. They have served their constituency interests to the best of their abilities, and according to their lights. I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge, when he replies to the debate, that his party will be the poorer for losing their services. Today\'s debate has revealed the state of flux in which agriculture finds itself. Despite the apparent differences between the two opening Front-Bench speeches, I believe that there is a large measure of agreement between them about the essential problems of the industry. The debate was, however, given a certain spice by the hon. Member for Suffolk, Central (Mr. Lord)-a Tory Member-who suggested that his party should adopt a policy abandoned by the Labour party after the 1987 general election. Similarly, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) suggested that the Government adopt a policy rejected by the Liberal party after their defeat, on policy grounds, in the 1983 election. The debate has certainly been well informed, and, with the exception of the apparent disagreement between the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, good natured. I was, however, reassured by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), who told me that the Minister\'s comments had been "restrained". There is a growing consensus in Britain about agricultural politics, which must be good. If there is one thing that the agriculture industry needs, it is stability and long-term confidence. We believe that, if the growing consensus helps to bring that about, we shall all have served our country and industry well. There is agreement about three of the principal matters that have been debated this evening. First, on the question of budgetary limits, the Minister, in his typically robust way, made it clear that he intends to resist any breach of those limits in Europe. My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) said that the Minister would receive our support. With one or two exceptions, the House believes that the Minister is following the right cause and we wish him well in defending those budgetary limits. Secondly, there is agreement that there must be reform of the common agricultural policy. We all recognise that and many of us believe that it is desirable. Thirdly, there is largely agreement that we must now try to change the direction of agricultural support away from commodity price support and redirect it into environmental and countryside payments. That case was put effectively and persuasively by the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton). I was pleased to hear that she now accepts the policies that the Labour party has advocated, at least for the previous couple of years. If there is a disagreement between the two principal sides in the debate it is a difference in the mechanism that we think is necessary to ensure that the changes take place in an orderly way. It appears that the Government are relying over-heavily on the application of market forces. They will seek robustly-as is the Minister\'s way-to secure price cuts in the belief that the cuts will lead to a restructuring of British agriculture. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones), the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery made it clear that that process would have a devastating effect on the rural communities that they represent. It will mean farm mergers and bankruptcies. It will also mean that farmers will continue to leave the land in large numbers and that the rural communities in their constituencies- and in many constituencies in the north and west of Britain -will be impoverished. We believe that the change must be a managed change, which takes account of the real needs of the British countryside, of the British consumer and of British farmers. We are not prepared to rely to the same extent that the Minister appears to do on the mechanism of the market. In opening the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields pressed the Minister for details of the alternative policy that he wishes to adopt to redirect the payments for countryside management and environmental purposes. The Minister was untypically reserved in offering the House details of his policy. I was reminded of a report that I read of an address by the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to the Oxford farming conference this year. He began with the memorable words: What I say neither is nor isn\'t Government policy". To judge by the Government\'s response to the Commission\'s proposal, it neither was nor was not Government policy as the Government do not have a policy for it not to be. If we are unable to judge the Government\'s position from their policy for the future, we can at least examine their record over the recent past, and it is a pretty miserable record at that. Last year British farming sank further into unprecedented indebtedness now totalling GBP 7 billion. The farmers who continued to struggle were forecast to earn real incomes only half of the levels of those in the early 1980s. In response to that domestic catastrophe, the Minister talks continuously about the importance of restructuring agriculture in other EC states. We know what he means by restructuring: he means throwing farmers off the land. It must be said that it is a subject on which he is well qualified to speak as he knows a lot about it. During the 1980s-10 years of Conservative Government-we lost farmers at the rate of six each day. However, since the present Minister was promoted to guard our agricultural interests at Cabinet level, that steady flow has turned into a flood. Not six but 16 farmers a day go out of business. Wales and Scotland both have a higher proportion of the work force who are still involved in agriculture than has England. In Wales, we had a recent report from Professor Midmore of Aberystwyth university which warned that a further 11,000 jobs might be lost in the next two years. Two weeks ago, the Scottish agricultural college warned that half of Scotland\'s farm workers will be redundant by 2015. If the Government\'s record is one of a huge decline in the United Kingdom\'s agricultural work force, can they claim that at least it has benefited the consumer? Not a bit. We all now know the figure used by the National Consumer Council in its 1988 paper, in which the cost of the common agricultural policy was identified as GBP 14 a week for each family of four persons. The financial costs of agriculture are conventionally denominated in ecus and the inappropriately named green currencies. Costs are also paid in environmental terms. If we were to add the environmental to the financial costs of the common agricultural policy, we should find that the true figure was far higher. There has been some tinkering at the edges in an attempt to reduce environmental damage, and some of the schemes, although limited, have been successful. Others have so far failed, largely because of the Ministry\'s mismanagement and lack of urgency. An example was the farm and conservation grant scheme payments for pollution control which were promised but never came. Over most of the country, we still have an agricultural policy that encourages environmental destruc-tion-the same policy which has ruined so much of our landscape, polluted our water and destroyed our wildlife habitat. It is also a sad fact that British farmers, by and large, are held in low esteem by many members of the public. A notable exception is the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells). Let me hasten to say that I do not blame the farmers for that state of affairs. They are in the same position as the publicans of biblical times. I should add-and I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the analogy-that the biblical publicans were the equivalent of today\'s revenue men. Asked to do unpopular things, they do them as best they can. However, as they can survive only by practising a policy that is universally derided, they are bound to be criticised by the public who pay their wages. Farmers are certainly not assisted by a Ministry which is widely disbelieved by the public and which has shown itself to be incapable, as currently structured, of taking an independent regulatory role to ensure at least the safety, if not the financial wellbeing, of the consumer. If the Ministry\'s record is pretty dismal-and I am sorry that the Minister finds it a source of amusement that 70 per cent. of the British public believe that his Ministry cannot be believed when it talks about food safety-can we at least pay tribute to the fact that the industry is prepared for the challenges of the single market? I am afraid that we cannot. United Kingdom farming is singularly unprepared to face 1993 with confidence. Investment levels are pitifully low. The National Farmers Union briefing on the Government publication"Agriculture in the UK:1990" said: Over the five years to 1989 farmers\' annual investment in fixed capital fell by 40 per cent. Our own estimates suggest a further fall of about 15 per cent. in 1990. That slump in investment is additional evidence of the gravity of agriculture\'s economic crisis. It is especially worrying as 1992 and the single market approach. If private sector investment is low, can we look to the Government to provide assistance? Again, unfortunately, we cannot. Let us consider the question of the slaughtering industry, which was raised by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and is of great concern to us in Wales. Last December, I asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assistance he had given to help slaughterhouses in the Province reach European Community export standards. The reply was that, over the five years to 31 March, GBP 4&#183;5 million had been paid for improvements to slaughterhouses in Northern Ireland. Encouraged by this, I tabled a similar question to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Back came the answer that the Department does not provide any special financial assistance for compliance with EC standards in slaughterhouses. Ditto Wales; ditto Scotland. In Northern Ireland, thanks to its relatively progressive policy of encouraging private investment, 74 per cent. of slaughterhouses meet European export standards. In Scotland, the figure is 35 per cent.; in England it is 7 per cent.; and in Wales it is a miserable 5 per cent. How on earth does the Minister expect British agriculture to compete with European agriculture and Northern Ireland agriculture in the years following 1 January 1993? Last month\'s excellent report on the slaughtering sector from the Farmers\' Union of Wales should dispel any complacency still lingering in the Minister\'s mind. We have also seen the survey of all British slaughterhouses by the Meat and Livestock Commission, which showed a hidebound industry with very low investment. According to the commission\'s chief economist, Some abattoirs are not sure what is required of them, and some do not see 1992 as a reality. What kind of preparation for 1993 is this? What kind of lead are the Government giving to ensure that agriculture is fit to face the challenges of the single market? I suppose that the slaughtering sector should heave a sigh of relief that all that it has suffered is malign neglect. Not so the state veterinary service. Hon. Members will be familiar with the disaster that has befallen the veterinary investigation service, involving the recent closure of another seven centres, with the loss of 52 posts-an act that the Minister describes as improvements in the quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the service". It is a view that is not shared by the practitioners. Mr. A. J. C. Parker, secretary of the Cornwall Veterinary Association, writing in the Veterinary Record, said of the closure of the Truro centre: The chief veterinary officer is now expecting the profession in Cornwall to provide material for their nearest investigation centre, Starcross, which, for some areas of Cornwall, represents a 300-mile round trip. He must be joking. I do not think it is much of a joke, and I do not think that British agriculture will find it much of a joke. That is just the veterinary investigation service. Other aspects of the state veterinary service have been cut, with staffing levels now down 20 per cent. on the figure of 10 years ago, at a time of unprecedented public concern about food quality and safety-not to mention animal welfare. Research and development has gone the same way. Just over a month ago, the Ministry issued a press notice which said: Baroness Trumpington urges food industry to invest in R and D"- and I am surprised that the notice did not have a sub-text saying, "because the Ministry of Agriculture certainly will not do it on your behalf". According to the Agriculture and Food Research Council officials, 300 further jobs in agricultural research and development will go this year. In the Ministry\'s own directly-provided service-the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service-a crisis is building up. According to its director-general, Peter Bunyan, the farm and countryside service, which is responsible for the very service that the hon. Member for Congleton thinks will be at the heart of our system of agriculture, is down to a level where it is difficult for those who remain to cope with the current workloads. We have looked at the dismal state of the agricultural infrastructure in the United Kingdom. What about marketing? The difficulties here were vividly illustrated by the hon. Member for Ludlow. Last year, the food and drink sector of the United Kingdom economy had the largest deficit of all sectors. Why should this be so when the lion\'s share of the deficit was with countries that have climates similar to, or worse than, our own? Could this, as was suggested by the hon. Gentleman, be related to the fact that our own marketing and promotion organisation -Food From Britain-has a budget one seventh the size of that in France or Germany? Or could it be that the confidence of British consumers in domestic produce is diminished by their inability to trust the Ministry to safeguard their welfare and safety? However, there is hope for the industry. That hope is to be found in reforming agriculture policy away from overwhelming reliance on price support as the mechanism for maintaining farm incomes. It must go towards the concept of environmental management, or green premiums. As we refine and hone our policy, it is increasingly clear that the Labour party is a source of inspiration for the Government\'s position on countryside management via agricultural policy. It is a policy that we advocated two years ago. It is a policy now belatedly being accepted by this Government. The trouble is that, even though the Government are adopting the policy, they are not doing much at the moment about implementing it. Let us look at the Government\'s claims about their achievements in this area. The Minister wrote in The Times on 1 April-April fool\'s day, quite appropriately-as follows: Support through payments linked to production must fall and there must be more emphasis on direct payments for custody of the countryside. Britain", he proudly proclaimed, has been the leader in this change. Later in the same article the Minister wrote: We must also begin to bring agricultural prices up to a more realistic level. That is an odd position to take if one believes that farmers should be paid more for countryside management and less for crop production. It is also somewhat inconsistent with the Minister\'s self-proclaimed pre-eminence among the price cutters in the Council of Ministers. Perhaps he can explain how higher food prices can be reconciled with food surpluses and the need to liberalise trade and reduce the gap between world and European Community prices. Nor am I sure how this fits in with the Government\'s proclaimed view of reducing inflation as its central economic objective. As for the claim that Britain is in the lead in introducing environmental criteria into agricultural policy-precisely the point developed by the Minister in his opening speech -let us turn to a more impartial source than The Times. We could not have one more impartial than Agra-Europe, which commented thus three weeks ago on the same subject: The Dutch and the Danes have already agreed agricultural environmental legislation which is far in advance of that in other EC countries. So much for the Minister\'s claim. The specific areas in which the Minister boasted so much for Britain were as follows: Our schemes for Environmentally Sensitive Areas set the pattern for Europe, as have our encouragement of farm woodlands and broadleaf planting, our establishment of nitrate-sensitive areas, our aid for diversification and our support for organic farming. Let us consider those points individually. ESAs have been a success, I acknowledge that, as we have acknowledged it continually since they were adopted. However, the payment levels were fixed and have not been reviewed, and in the period since they were fixed they have been effectively devalued by 23&#183;4 per cent. The Government have refused to maintain their value-some commitment to ESAs. The Ministry makes great claims for farm woodlands and broadleaf planting. They are admirable schemes, but his target is 12,000 hectares per annum. The latest figures from the Forestry Commission show a planting total of barely half the target. In Wales, where we have particular problems as a result of the decline in farm incomes, we have had a grand total since the scheme has been implemented of 93 hectares over three years under the farm woodland scheme. For diversification, one of the Minister\'s own schemes for the maintenance of farm incomes by encouraging alternative enterprises, the story is pretty much the same. Expenditure during the first three years of the scheme\'s operation totalled less than GBP 5 million and, according to recent Ministry figures, during that period farm incomes fell by a massive GBP 152 million. The most ridiculous claim is the one that the Minister makes for his assistance to organic farming. He has been promising us year after year that he will shortly be announcing his organic conversion scheme. It appears to me that the Government still hold the view of the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), who described organic farming as "a way to rip off the customer". We have never had a repudiation of that view from the Ministry of Agriculture. Now that the right hon. Member has forcibly left the Government and decided to spend more time with his family, perhaps the Minister would take this opportunity to repudiate that view and assert that organic farming does have a role to play. I can imagine the Minister making that announcement, kitted out in a purple track suit. Hee would be the Government\'s own Mr. Green-the David Icke of the Tory party-though it would require some nimble footwork to accommodate Mr. Icke\'s bizarre spiritualism into the Minister\'s High Church Anglicanism. I said at the outset that we had shared objectives. But our means of achieving them are very different. We agree on the necessity to redirect support away from production and towards environmental goals. We recognise that we shall in future operate within international trading constraints which may make even the regular EC budgetary wrangles seem easy and harmonious. Where we differ is in our approach to the type of assistance to agriculture which is measured not in ecus and aggregate measures of support but in our commitment to the agricultural infrastructure, to investment, to training, to research and development, to adequate veterinary manpower, to food safety measures and to marketing. Those matters are not the subject of GATT negotiation or EC legal cases on unfair competition. Neither GATT negotiators nor EC Commissioners care two hoots about how much we support those aspects of our agriculture industries-except, in the case of the latter, the other EC members probably support the British Government\'s destructive line on the ground that it benefits their national agricultural industries. After all, the more damage the British Government do here, the less other member Governments have to invest to continue out-competing us. It is in the interest of us all-farmers, consumers and environmentalists-to get our agriculture policy right. We have shared objectives on the central thrust of agricultural restructuring. But the Government must recognise that there is a role for the public sector. They must restore the cuts that they have made in investment in that infrastructure. Only by doing that shall we be in a position in 1993 to compete on a level playing field with our trading partners in Europe.'];;neutral
1996-01-10a.123.6.txt;;["I am extremely grateful for this debate about the regeneration of the coalfield communities. This is the first Wednesday debate of the new year, which is a time for reflection and recollection-a time to draw lessons from the past but also to tackle the coming year with new hope and resolution. That is what the coalfield communities are doing. It is also what they were doing three years ago. The House will recall that in October 1992 the then President of the Board of Trade announced the closure of 31 of Britain's 50 collieries. That decision was taken away for reflection and reconsideration, and in May 1993 the review was finalised, with consequences that are now plain to see: massive job losses in the coal industry and many collieries closed. I have a new year's resolution of my own, which is not to alienate my colleagues. I know that members of the miners group are to meet my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) at 10.30 this morning-I am sure that they too are tackling the new year with new resolution-so I shall be brief because I know that some of them want to contribute. Indeed, I hope that everyone connected with the coalfield communities will have a chance to speak this morning. In Nottinghamshire, the consequences of the pit review are clear: six collieries have closed and 10,428 people who used to work in the coal industry have lost their jobs. Moreover, 4,100 people connected with the secondary industries have also lost their jobs, and there has been a loss of spending power in the local economy of GBP 550 million a year-a significant amount. Unemployment in Nottinghamshire is still unacceptably high and there is real deprivation. To be sure, unemployment has fallen, but I urge the Minister to look closely at the figures. In October 1992 unemployment in Nottinghamshire stood at about the national average. Now it is above it, and in certain pockets unemployment has risen against the trend. I am sure that some of my colleagues will mention the fact that unemployment in the coalfield communities is understated. I have looked carefully at a report by Sheffield Hallam university which suggests that male unemployment in the coalfield areas is in the region of 20 to 35 per cent. That compares with the national norm of 15 per cent., calculated on the same basis. Even more significant is a comparison between national unemployment figures since October 1992 and unemployment in coalfield travel-to-work areas. Since October 1992, national unemployment has fallen by 17 per cent. In the Mansfield travel-to-work area over the same period, the percentage decrease has been just 7.1. In the Worksop travel-to-work area-another coalfield area-unemployment has fallen by less than 1 per cent. So unemployment may be falling generally, but the rates differ according to area and the gap between the rich and the poor appears to be growing. The Government were aware that those problems would occur and in their announcement they offered an aid package worth GBP 200 million over three years. I calculate that GBP 30 million of that came to Nottinghamshire. The first question that I want to ask the Minister is what research has been undertaken on that aid package's effects. I have heard him and his colleagues talk about inputs into coalfield communities. Three years on from the closure announcement, we should consider some performance and output measures. How far has that GBP 200 million changed things in coalfield communities? I suspect that no research has been undertaken and that the reason for that is that the aid package was known to be inadequate at the beginning. It is short term-it will end during this calendar year. There is a scatter-gun approach-a shot at lots of moving targets, but no real strategy. There has been little co-ordination of that package. I want to consider some of the measures, including enterprise zones. I hope that the Minister will visit the three enterprise zones in Nottinghamshire, announced more than three years ago. Not one brick has been laid on any of those zones and, three years on, not one new job has been created. That is the measure of the success of the Government aid package. That is the position in Nottinghamshire, but the figures are similar throughout the country. I want the Minister to recall our debates, especially those on the Coal Industry Bill, when a number of us pressed the Government hard on what was to happen to British Coal's non-operational land, where there is a basis to create new jobs and which could be a cornerstone for new development land. Very little has happened. As the Minister knows, the Environment Act 1995 went through the House last year. That transfers liabilities for derelict land on to new owners. British Coal has been set different priorities. It has been told not only to dispose of the land and to create new jobs, but, clearly under section 11 of the Act, to get the best price and value for the land and to dispose of the liabilities. I understand that almost 80 sites were to be transferred to English Partnerships, the regeneration agency, to create new jobs in England. Three years on, that land has not been transferred. Strong discussions are taking place between British Coal and English Partnerships about who is responsible for the dereliction and who will clear up the liabilities. Clearly, English Partnerships would like to take the land, but it is not prepared to pick up an unlimited liability. If the Minister wants to help coalfield communities, he could intervene in that discussion and ensure that that land comes on to the market straight away. Smaller schemes that would lift the landscape and enhance the environment are also being held up. The county council in Nottinghamshire would like to acquire six former colliery tips from British Coal. Discussions are well advanced. The Forestry Commission would plant the sites and take responsibility. We could create a new Sherwood forest that would lift the landscape, yet the deal is stuck because there are questions about who is responsible for the liabilities. We want the landscape to be lifted and to see change, but because of arguments about liabilities, that deal too is stuck."];;positive
1996-11-06a.1289.0.txt;;["It is one of the unexpected charms of our debates that occasionally they offer an opportunity to stray from the often rather boring highways of principle and generality, and suddenly focus on a good old solid object, something readily identifiable, something even photogenic. Such is the case in our debate for there has swum into our ken a magical piece of woodland in my constituency known as Hagg Wood, near the village of Dunnington, which is close to York. Hagg Wood has acquired even greater significance, even notoriety, from the revelation by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) that not only was he born and bred in the village of Dunnington, which is close to Hagg Wood, but that, since an early age, he has often wandered freely up and down its charming highways and byways, its footpaths and bridleways. It is greatly to the credit of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras that he was born and bred in that delightful village of Dunnington. In the spirit of bipartisan good will, it is very much to the credit of the village of Dunnington, which is very small, that it should have borne and bred a well-known national public figure. I hope that honours are even, in that context at any rate. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras and the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) are deeply concerned that the rights of access enjoyed by them, myself and many others in the locality are about to be disallowed or overridden. Let me try to reassure them and my hon. Friends about that. I should make it clear that the Church Commission should never be thought of as an object of suspicion or derision in the House, because it is a creature of Parliament. It is the repository of the charitable funds of the Church of England. It was set up by Parliament, and Madam Speaker is a prominent Church Commissioner. The Church Commission, with its distinguished basis and pedigree, is the owner of the freehold of the woodland, which is let on a 999-year lease to the Forestry Commission. I hasten to reassure the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for York, although that reassurance may be only temporary, that the woodland is not on the market, although the Forestry Commission had earlier considered the sale of its lease, and may do so again in the future. Even if the lease was sold-the Church Commissioners would derive no profit or advantage from that, because it would merely mean a transfer of the leaseholder-the public footpaths and bridleways that go through Hagg Wood would be fully protected. I can identify at least three of them on the map of it that I have before me. The hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for York would be able, whatever the sale and to whomever it was made, to exercise their right to walk on that land. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras asked a specific question about the benefit that the Church Commissioners might derive from the remission of rent and rate liabilities, which is a feature of the Bill. The Church Commissioners invariably require the licensee or leaseholder to meet the usual outgoings, including rates, rents and so on, as part of the licence or lease they offer. We therefore do not stand to be in prospect of any particular advantage. It would accrue to a licence holder, who would have to pay those rents and rates normally. Having sketched in the background, and attempted to reassure the hon. Members for York and for Holborn and St. Pancras, I must point out that Hagg Wood is not and never has been subject to a so-called open access agreement under the terms of the leasehold held by the Forestry Commission. In principle, such an agreement means the complete and unregulated freedom to roam and ramble over field and forest, anywhere and everywhere, whenever and wherever any individual might choose so to ramble or roam. Open access is not an appropriate form of freedom where productive enterprises-whether agriculture and farming or cultivating and growing timber-are carried on. Many of the Church Commissioners' woodlands are located in the middle of agricultural holdings, and access to those woods has to be gained across tenanted productive farm land. The reasonable interests, both agricultural and sporting, of our tenants must be protected and we have some weighty allies in our approach to that issue. For example, the Council for the Protection of Rural England writes: We do not support the principle of unqualified right to roam &#8230; We recognise the value of securing provision for access and recreation through voluntary agreements where appropriate. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors goes even further, saying: Many areas of the countryside are too sensitive to allow 'right to roam' to operate unconstrained. Reasons why public access is inappropriate include: crop damage, livestock disturbance, sporting activities, health and safety, protection of wildlife and landscape features. I believe that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, thinking back on his experiences in Hagg wood, would understand the reasonableness of the provisos and caveats that people familiar with the countryside would want to make so as to protect many countryside features."];;neutral
1998-06-25a.1247.0.txt;;["I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) for not taking two and a half hours to explain her case to the House. I am sure that all hon. Members will be pleased about that, as we were expecting to get extremely late trains tonight. It is pleasant that we may be able to get home a little earlier than we had planned. I am pleased also that my hon. Friend has raised the issue of the proper protection of the forest of Dean. As she said, I have twice met her and delegations of her constituents, including local councillors, to discuss the potential problems in the forest of Dean and the best way forward in resolving their concerns. I therefore feel that I have a reasonable grasp of the specific worries of those campaigning for greater protection of the forest of Dean. I also continue to believe that-as she said-we identified early in our discussions, in October 1997, the most effective and realistic way forward. I recognise the fears of many of my hon. Friend's constituents over their vision of large-scale new quarrying in the forest of Dean. As has been clearly explained in this debate, the forest of Dean is a beautiful part of our countryside. However, traditionally, it has also been a hard-working area in which mining has been an important local industry. The concerns of my hon. Friend and her constituents have centred, although not exclusively, on the quarrying industry. We have an established and long-standing system in Britain for regulating the activities of the quarrying industry. The system balances modern society's need for the industry's products with careful planning of the industry's location and activities and regard for its environmental impact. The mechanisms for considering the industry's impact at the local level is the minerals local plan. Such plans are the mechanism against which the granting of minerals permissions is assessed across the country, and the mechanism that must be used in the forest of Dean. I believe that the fears that have grown in the forest of Dean because of possible development of new quarries are a result of the early work of Gloucestershire county council on the minerals local plan for Gloucestershire. Last year, Gloucestershire county council's officials identified certain areas in the forest that would be capable of meeting the county's sub-regional apportionment of aggregates provision. That early exploratory work did not constitute an invitation to the quarrying industry to submit applications for new quarries; nor did it necessarily mean that the areas that the officials were considering would appear in the final version of the Gloucestershire minerals local plan. As I have often made clear to campaigners from the forest of Dean, the way of resolving those matters is for Gloucestershire county council to produce the minerals local plan for public scrutiny. As my hon. Friend said, I have written to Gloucestershire county council to remind it of the importance of producing its plan. Forest of Dean campaigners asked me to do that, and I did so very soon after our meeting. All future quarrying planning applications will be considered with reference to that plan, and it is crucial, therefore, that it is debated and agreed at the local level as quickly as possible. That debate can properly include a public inquiry, if that turns out to be appropriate. The debate will not only eventually resolve the question of any possible new quarrying within the forest, but help in assessing whether any new additional environmental status needs to be given to the forest of Dean. On the role of the inspector in the context of a public inquiry into the minerals local plan, I must make it clear that the plan inquiry could not make any decisions about special status for the forest of Dean. The role of an inspector in the local plan process is to hold the inquiry into objections to the published local plan and to report to the council with recommendations. He or she carries out that role independently, against the background of existing Government policy, so it would not be appropriate for Ministers to issue any instructions to the inspector in relation to any possible status for the forest of Dean. Nevertheless, in subsequently considering the appropriateness of special status, Ministers would have the benefit of any views expressed at the inquiry or in written representations and recorded in the inspector's report to the council. To be relevant to the inquiry, those views would need to be expressed as objections to a particular proposal in the plan. The campaigners for the protection of the forest have to recognise that there is no immediately available one-off solution by which I could simply exclude all quarrying from the forest of Dean. I cannot draw a line around the area and issue a proclamation. Even in national parks there is not an absolute ban on quarrying, although there has to be a strong case to allow new quarrying in such areas. The Government have made our determination on those matters clear in our decision not to approve an extension to Spaunton quarry in the North York moors national park. Two national designations are potentially available to the Government in awarding landscape and planning protection to the forest of Dean. They are the designations of national park or area of outstanding natural beauty. Both are concerned with far more than merely quarrying. The delegations that I have met from the forest of Dean have said that they do not consider either of those designations as appropriate to the forest. That is because both designations apply strong planning protection, which some people fear might adversely affect some of the imaginative regeneration schemes that are being developed for the forest. That demonstrates the difficulty involved in achieving just the right level of protection to safeguard the environment, while nurturing the development of local communities. I now understand that my hon. Friend is looking for a solution that takes into account the various other pressures on the forest, such as those from visitor numbers. Those issues are central to the system of protected areas designation. The Countryside Commission has been undertaking work on various questions concerned with protected areas nationally and is about to submit its formal report to the Government. That will deal with the future status and management arrangements of the New forest and the south downs, as well as the Countryside Commission's proposals for enhanced funding and management of areas of outstanding natural beauty. As a follow-up to that advice, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has asked the Countryside Commission to look again at the forest of Dean. Since the criteria for national park status were laid down in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, the forest of Dean has never been among the limited number of areas considered potentially suitable as a national park. It was given at least informal consideration as an area of outstanding natural beauty, but that has so far not come to fruition. I understand that, in the 1950s and 1960s, when most of the designation programme was proceeding, there may have been an assumption that the involvement of the Forestry Commission in the forest of Dean was sufficient to provide the protection required. I am told that the matter was last looked at in 1971, when the local authorities concerned were consulted, but did not wish to proceed with designation as an area of outstanding natural beauty. The Wye valley area of outstanding natural beauty, which was designated in 1971, runs along the western edge of the forest. Whatever the previous conclusions and despite the earlier doubts of the anti-quarrying campaigners about area of outstanding natural beauty status, times change and the Countryside Commission is now looking afresh at the question. In consultation with the local authorities and the Forestry Commission, the Countryside Commission is employing specialist consultants to help it to review how the position has changed since 1971, the land management, access and recreation pressures, the potential impact of any future minerals extraction and what the options might be, including AONB designation, to secure the future of the forest of Dean. There will be a steering group to take account of the views and interests of the key stakeholders, and the commission is looking carefully at the best way to take account of wider views. As part of the study, the commission will look expressly at the suitability of AONB designation. Planning policy guidance provides that any applications for new or extended mineral workings in areas of outstanding natural beauty must be subject to the most rigorous examination and be demonstrated to be in the public interest. In general, policies and development control decisions affecting areas of outstanding natural beauty should favour conservation of the natural beauty of the landscape. The Countryside Commission could recommend a special status, but the one option available to it without primary legislation but with the support of the Secretary of State would be an area of outstanding natural beauty. As my hon. Friend knows, if the commission recommended special status and the Government accepted the recommendation, it would require primary legislation; it would have to join the queue and could take some time to get through. I hope that campaigners in the forest of Dean will make what they want known to the commission. My hon. Friend referred to the position in the New forest as a possible way forward for the forest of Dean. I can assure my hon. Friend that the campaigners for greater protection in the New forest are not happy with the current arrangements there. In 1994, the previous Government took the unusual decision to award the New forest heritage area the planning status of a national park, without the usual designation or administrative arrangements for a national park. They wanted the boundary of the heritage area to be defined in the local plan process. The fact that that process is still not complete shows the cumbersome nature of those arrangements, and I think that my hon. Friend referred to the time that had been taken already. As I have said, Ministers will shortly be looking at the Countryside Commission's advice on the possible ways forward in the New forest. I do not regard the current arrangements in the New forest as a suitable precedent for the forest of Dean. In any case, those were based on the long-standing view of the Countryside Commission, which is responsible for the designations subject to the confirmation of the Secretary of State, that the New forest is suitable for a national park level of designation under the terms of the 1949 Act. The forest of Dean is a different case. It has not been considered appropriate for national park status under the legislation, but, as I have made clear, the question of AONB status remains open. I am glad to have had the opportunity to give those issues a proper airing in the debate. The House will recognise that, far from reneging on an election pledge, the Government are tackling the issue of quarrying in the forest of Dean head on. Before coming to power, we said that we would consult local groups, local businesses and the district and county councils on how best to sustain the character and prosperity of the forest and its community. I have made it plain that the best way to achieve that consultation in the context of quarrying in the forest of Dean is to use the existing public inquiry procedures, which occur during the preparation of Gloucestershire county council's minerals local plan. We have also now provided an opportunity for views to be fed to the Countryside Commission as part of a wide-ranging look at what might be the best means of providing appropriate protection for the forest in the future. Those who really have the interests of the forest at heart should now get down and concentrate their energies on putting across their views in the public debate at the local level. That is where the decisions can be affected. It would be pleasing if the reporting were slightly more objective; it would not be a bad idea if, from time to time, journalists contacted the Department, so that we could put our views. That would allow for a slightly more constructive debate than the one that has being going on in some of the heavy newspapers and the Sundays. I hope that I have outlined a clear way in which our manifesto pledge can now be carried out. I hope, very genuinely, that those who have visited my office over the past few months will now get down to putting their case succinctly to the two bodies that are considering it-the minerals plan inquiry and the Countryside Commission. I am sure that we will be able to find a satisfactory solution to what clearly is a problem."];;neutral
1999-06-30a.292.2.txt;;["I agree. We would not have a wind farm in the Wye valley, but we might on the limestone escarpment at its edge, and, if that was visible from other vistas, it would detract from the landscape's beauty. When the Hobhouse report designated our national parks and the areas of outstanding natural beauty, it left out one or two important areas, one of which was the Forest of Dean. As the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) said, the New Forest was also exempt from the designation. The Forest of Dean shares many of the characteristics of that landscape. We, too, have a verderers court and an area which is administered by the Forestry Commission. We do not have commoners, but we do have sheep badgers. That same mix of beautiful landscape and heritage linked to agriculture, forestry and the area's culture meant that the Forest of Dean was not included."];;neutral
2005-02-08a.1479.1.txt;;['Exactly: it is a good example not of cutting trees but of cross-cutting government. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is planning to address the issue as soon as parliamentary time permits. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will certainly continue to press it to do so.The removal of the exemption allowing work on dying trees would in particular boost the protection of veteran trees, which, as my hon. Friend also pointed out, often contain a significant proportion of dead wood, as they take a long time to die. He also mentioned the felling regulations, which require permission to be sought from the Forestry Commission when a landowner wishes to fell an area of woodland. These applications are carefully considered before a licence is granted. Restocking conditions can be attached to such licences, and in many cases, the new woodland that is established is an improvement in quality on that which it replaces.As the House will be aware, many of our finest concentrations of veteran trees and ancient woodlands have extra statutory protection through designation as sites of special scientific interest. I am thinking, for example, of the New Forest, Sherwood forest and the trees of Windsor great park. More than a quarter of England\'s 4,000-plus SSSIs, making up more than 115,000 hectares, have significant woodland conservation interest. Almost three quarters of woodland SSSIs are in favourable condition, which is ahead of the average for all SSSIs. Some of the woodland SSSIs are also special areas of conservation under the habitats directive, which recognises their importance at European level.Protection and enhancement of veteran trees and ancient woodland is, however, about much more than regulation and statutory designation. It is also about raising awareness-something that is partly helped by debates such as this-of the value of our trees and woodlands among all who can influence their management. That is why projects such as the one to which my hon. Friend referred, the Ancient Tree Forum\'s ancient tree hunt, is partly funded by the Forestry Commission, which is a member of the DEFRA family, as well as the work of the Woodland Trust to draw attention to the special value of veteran trees and ancient woodland, are to be applauded.For our part, in 2002 we published the England biodiversity strategy, "Working with the grain of nature", which set out a programme of activity to ensure the integration of biodiversity into policy making and practice. One of the key aims in the strategy is to conserve and enhance the biodiversity of woodlands, and particularly ancient semi-natural woodlands, veteran trees and wood pasture. The woodlands and forestry workstream, which helped to prepare the strategy, is currently undertaking a detailed work plan to tackle important issues such as the protection of woodland from external threats, which my hon. Friend mentioned, conserving and enhancing the biodiversity of native woodland, and the conservation of woodland biodiversity in the wider landscape.I turn now to one or two of the issues that my hon. Friend raised that are the specific responsibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The new draft guidance in the planning policy statement for biodiversity, PPS9, which he mentioned, makes a big step forward in recognising the biodiversity value of ancient woodland. The draft PPS now requires local authorities to identify ancient woodland of highest biodiversity value that is not already protected by statutory designation. We believe that that identification process will assist local authorities in ensuring that the biodiversity value of such sites is fully considered in decisions on planning proposals. It will also ensure that development affecting ancient woodland is not allowed to go ahead unless any loss or deterioration is clearly outweighed by the need for and benefits of the proposed development.I give my hon. Friend the assurance that we will not make any decision on the final wording of PPS9 until all responses to the consultation, including those from the Woodland Trust and the Ancient Tree Forum, have been fully considered. We expect to publish a final version of PPS9, together with its accompanying circular and a good practice guide, in mid&#8211;2005.For many years, the Forestry Commission has recognised the value of our ancient woodlands, and it is preparing a new statement on ancient woodland policy. The new statement will confirm our commitment to the protection and enhancement of ancient woodlands and will be backed by new management guidelines for ancient and native woodlands that gives practical advice to woodland managers. The new English woodland grants scheme will provide a framework for the provision of incentives to encourage the management of ancient woodland and the creation of new woodland.My hon. Friend referred to another way in which we are encouraging the management of individual trees and small groups of trees. DEFRA\'s new high-level scheme is one of our agri-environment schemes under common agricultural policy reform. It will provide incentives for various works to conserve and manage veteran trees, including pollarding, surgery and protection from encroachment. Although I appreciate my hon. Friend\'s concerns about designation, because we have such a large proportion of Europe\'s ancient and veteran trees-far more than any other country-our overall approach is concentrated on some of the very good schemes, rather than the labour and resource-intensive process of cataloguing every single veteran tree in the country. That policy is under constant review and I have heard his representations tonight. For the time being, however, our overall approach to building on our wonderful resource of ancient woodland and veteran trees is best done by building on the existing work, including tree preservation orders, planning policy statements, ancient woodland policy, agri-environmental schemes and woodland grants.'];;positive
2005-06-06a.1085.0.txt;;['This is an important Bill for the English and Welsh countryside, as has been made clear by the quality of today\'s debate and by the fact that eight of my hon. Friends elected to make their maiden speeches. That is a clear demonstration of the genuine Conservative empathy with the countryside, rather than the caricature that we are only interested in hunting. Indeed, until 9.15 this evening, the only person to have mentioned hunting in this debate was the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker).This debate gives me the opportunity to welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), and I look forward to debating the Bill with him during its further stages. We have heard a number of maiden speeches today, including that of the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Horwood). I am afraid that he lost my support when he suggested that people should go to Cheltenham race course rather than to   Newmarket in my constituency. We also heard eight exceptional maiden speeches from Conservative Members, all of whom bring credit to these Benches. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) clarified the distinction between trial bikes and trail bikes-there is a great difference between the two-and referred to the new land army of bureaucrats with clipboards. I understand from today\'s paper that he is a member of the new model army, and we look forward to his further contributions.My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) spoke with great fervour of the joy of representing the constituency in which he grew up. He spoke of the importance of local accountability and democracy and of the protection of green fields-an issue that arose again and again during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) also mentioned it, when he referred to the damage done by bad planning decisions taken in Kenilworth. He also spoke of the need to decide what we want the countryside to be and of the interdependence of agriculture and the environment.My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) rightly paid tribute to Sydney Chapman-all of us across the House miss his company-and reminded us of his environmental credentials. She, too, raised the issue of the impact of development and told us that a third of her constituency consisted of green belt and open space.My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (John Penrose) made a lucid and fluent maiden speech about the unchanging nature of parts of his constituency. He also mentioned the problems of planning and overdevelopment in other parts of the area. His views on that were shared by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), who illustrated that his constituency consists of more than concrete cows-it contains real countryside and real rural communities.My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) rightly paid tribute to English Nature, which is based in his constituency, and showed himself to be the robust Member that we in Cambridgeshire have long known that he had the potential to be. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Herbert) used the words "kindness" and "Whips" in the same sentence, which he will probably not do for much longer. He also spoke of the problems of new housing and its impact on the countryside.In moving our amendment, my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) rightly said that we support many of the measures in the Bill. The issue of green lanes, in relation to trail riding and four-wheel-drive vehicles, has been widely rehearsed across the Chamber tonight, and it is clear that there is unanimity among everyone who has spoken, not only on the nature of the problem, but on the need to get on with sorting it out quickly, as the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) said. I also endorse everything that my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) has just said.My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) made the point that many of the people concerned want mud to make their journeys more exciting. In relation to the Human Rights Act 1998 getting in the way of this legislation, I find it difficult to accept that walkers or riders are denied their human rights because they cannot walk or ride where that mud is.Of course, we support the measures to improve protection of sites of special scientific interest, wildlife, biodiversity and many other areas. All the concerns that we might have on the detail can be addressed in Committee. I hope and, from earlier conversations, believe that the Minister will seek to engage constructively on those issues. But if I may say so, all those parts have been added to what is clearly a suitable legislative vehicle-part 1 of the Bill. Because part 1 is seriously wanting in achieving the objectives that the Government lay down, we must oppose the Bill, and have therefore tabled the amendment. I say to the hon. Member for Lewes, who scorned our position, that it is because we believe the flaws of part 1 are too major to be addressed by amendment in Committee that we have decided to table an amendment on Second Reading.A great deal has been made of simplification, removal of red tape and fewer visits-all those words were used by the Secretary of State-but I want to give one example of the sort of problem that exists today, and that will not be helped one iota by the proposals in this Bill. Unfortunately, the source of the story must be anonymous, as the farmer involved is understandably concerned about what might happen as regards the officials involved.The issue is one of a long-redundant ferry operating across an estuary in England, where the hard standing had been neglected for a century. A meeting was held to discuss restoring it. The meeting took all morning and was attended by two farmers who owned the land, one part-time volunteer ferry operator, one member of the local voluntary amenity association, somebody from the Environment Agency, two people from the planning department, one from English Nature, and two from the joint area of outstanding natural beauty partnership. Of the 10 people there, six were being paid by the taxpayer, but the Bill would not have made any difference-it would not have reduced attendance at that meeting by a single person. We cannot expect real change unless the problem of bureaucracy is properly addressed.We largely agree with the critique of Lord Haskins in relation to the current delivery system, but the Bill does not provide an answer. It creates a potentially massive organisation with conflicting priorities and powers to do anything that it likes. It does nothing to prevent over-zealous use of powers, and that problem already exists. It sets up three funding blocks, but does nothing directly to reduce the number of individual schemes or the form-filling. We are far from persuaded by the Government\'s position on the issue of the Forestry Commission.There is no recognition in the Bill of the importance of economic activity, particularly farming, in care for the countryside. Nowhere in the Bill is there any recognition that the landscape itself is a result of economic activity-not always for the better if judged by today\'s standards, but nevertheless paid for by local economic activity. The countryside and nature of England is not some twee chocolate box scene to be frozen in time: it is home to 23 per cent. of the population and the workplace of most of them. The Government have delegated some of the delivery to regional development agencies, whereas county councils and local councils could have done a better job with greater accountability. That raises the issue of the voice of those 23 per cent. and the proposed commission for rural communities. That body has no powers, is appointed by the Secretary of State and therefore has no credibility with rural communities.No Conservative Member doubts that rural people need a voice. We have watched for eight years while the Government have ignored their plight, even with the Countryside Agency and the rural advocate, so why would an even weaker body make any difference? The real voice of rural people is their elected representatives: local councillors and Members of the House. Indeed, it was that voice that spoke on 5 May and brought my hon. Friends to this place.Yet again, we have seen the tendency of the Government to believe that the public are best served by a large organisation lacking direct accountability. The objective of rationalisation and simplification is, of course, worthy but the chosen method is wrong. Instead, the Government should have examined how to simplify the system itself-the complexities of the single farm payment, of the entry level and higher level scheme. Those are all examples where simplification of the schemes could come ahead of changing the structures. The Government should have sought to work with existing local structures and local accountability. The flaws in their proposals are too great to be corrected by amendment. They should think again. I commend the amendment to the House.'];;neutral
2016-07-12b.218.0.txt;;["Let me begin by paying a huge tribute to the hon. Member for Tooting (Dr Allin-Khan) for an extraordinary maiden speech. It contained five elements that, I think, encapsulated the heart of this debate. First, there was her extraordinary sense of history, and the commitment that she showed in talking about Nye Bevan and the Clean Air Act 1956. Secondly, there was her sense of responsibility, and of the scale of the challenge that we face. Thirdly, there were her energy and optimism. Fourthly, there was her sense of place: she said she thought people who said that Tooting was becoming a fantastic place were missing the fact that-as she felt-it had been a fantastic place all her life. Finally, there was her sense of the importance of humans in the history of the landscape, whether she was talking about the lido at Tooting or about her own community and family.In general, through her rhetoric, through her language and through her love of this place, the hon. Lady-as the Member of Parliament who has entered the House at the moment when we are leaving the European Union-gave us a real reason to be optimistic about Parliament and the sovereignty of Parliament. The five elements that she contributed represent exactly what we hope to bring to the British environment in the future.An enormous number of questions have been asked today. The shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner), asked the Government to respond to specific queries on-I think-nine separate occasions. I counted 35 questions posed by him, and a further 117 posed by other Members. I have approximately nine minutes in which to answer those questions, and, with the House's permission, I will therefore focus on the natural environment rather than on energy issues, with apologies to the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Callum McCaig)-Callum senior. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Philip Boswell), who initiated an extremely erudite discussion of many energy-related issues, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington South (David Mowat), who drew attention to a number of ways in which domestic legislation underpinned UK energy policy, and explained that some of the references to the European Union were a little misleading.I shall not be able to engage as fully as I would like with the forensic speech made by the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy), although it was an extraordinary speech which raised an enormous number of very important points. However, I shall try to deal with those points in the round.In essence, four main types of point were made in this debate and they form the structure of an answer. First, the importance of being deeply optimistic about Britain's future outside the EU was pointed out, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton Deane (Rebecca Pow) and the Secretary of State. That is partly, as the Secretary of State said, because of the very real strengths that exist in this country. As Members on both sides pointed out, we derive immense positives from our membership of the EU, and they have been concisely listed. The hon. Members for York Central (Rachael Maskell), for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), for Bristol East and for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Calum Kerr) laid out the powerful progress made over the past 42 years in air and water quality, and that is driven by EU law and EU financial assistance, and by the structures of the EU that protected our landscape. As the hon. Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies) pointed out, it is important for our international industry to ensure we have uniform standards so there is not a race to the bottom. We cannot simply think about this island as though we were not exposed to environmental factors from abroad; 85% of our birds are migratory, and between a third and a half of our air blows in from other countries-that is the air pollution coming into our country. Indeed, our terrestrial biodiversity is dependent on ensuring there is not acid rain and sulphur dioxide raining on the peat bogs and grasses on which we depend.However, as my hon. Friends the Members for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison) and for Poole (Mr Syms) pointed out, we in the United Kingdom had a strong  tradition of environmentalism long before we joined the EU. Indeed, the history of environmental protection in the UK stretches back almost 1,000 years to the formation of the royal forests in Scotland and in England and the habitat protection brought in place to nearly 23% of our land mass at that period, and it carries on through the contributions of Walter Scott and Wordsworth to ensuring the protection of our landscapes. Indeed, over the next four years we will be celebrating several anniversaries: the centenary of the Forestry Commission, founded in 1919; the anniversary of our national parks, founded in 1947; and the anniversary of the Clean Air Act, passed in 1956.There will be opportunities available to us from leaving the EU. The hon. Member for Brent North pointed out that there have been some advantages from EU funding for flooding, but there have of course been significant challenges too. One way in which we would like to address natural responses to flood management is by planting trees. In order to do that, we need to be able to look at flexible and intelligent ways of moving money between what are currently quite rigid budget structures. If we are dealing with farmers planting trees on their land to slow the flow of water, we need to think intelligently about how the payments we give for agriculture, the environment and flooding can work together, rather than against each other. When looking at laws, we need to ensure we remain flexible with regard to the best of modern science, and there are ways in which rigid legal structures brought into place by 27 member states have in the past made it difficult to respond to recent evidence. Members raised the question of inspections and fines as well, and, again, those rigid inspection regimes have, at their worst, sometimes discredited the very environmental regulations we wish to protect. Finally, as my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) pointed out, there are perverse consequences of parts of the CAP for the environmental conditions we value  so much.The principles on which we now need to move forward were laid out very powerfully by this House, and by the hon. Member for Bristol East in her initial intervention, and they seem to me to be sixfold. They are the principles of realism, of humility, of honesty about conflict, of being honest with the public, of confidence and of identity. I shall expand briefly on those principles. First, on realism, we have to acknowledge that leaving the European Union will not mean leaving government behind. People will continue to be frustrated by bureaucracy and they will continue to have to respond to procurement regulations. We will continue to have to operate in  an international environment. We will have to make compromises.On the principle of humility, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton Deane rightly pointed out that not everyone in this country is always interested in the environment. We have to be realistic about our power and about our capacity as a Government to respond. On the principle of honesty about conflict, land remains a deeply conflicted issue. We must not imagine that simply leaving the European Union will overcome the serious conflicts between different land uses in our constituencies. There are conflicts between people's desire to build housing, people's desire to create renewable energy, people's desire to produce productive food and people's desire to protect the species and habitats that we value so much.The principles of confidence and identity are perhaps the most important of all. The decision in the referendum was made by one of the most well educated, well travelled populations in the most mature democracy on Earth, and we need to ensure that we recognise the legitimacy of that democratic choice. We need to put our full energy and optimism behind it. We need to understand, in responding to this, that the British identity-this extends to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-is based fundamentally on our land.In moving forward, we need to reassure people. As the Secretary of State pointed out, we need to play a full role in all our international conferences. We need to ensure, for example, that we play a responsible and reliable international role in the forthcoming conferences on biodiversity and on the convention on international trade in endangered species-CITES. We could also be far more imaginative."];;neutral
