The road zig-zags its way across this grid square on top of the ridge. The short wooden poles are known as "dragons' teeth" and are a Forestry Commission precaution to stop people driving vehicles off the road and onto the heathland. Most of the way along each side of the road a shallow ditch has been dug for the same reason.;;neutral
27595;;The cottage (marked as Hope Cottage on the OS map) is the only dwelling you see from the Roger Penny Way as you cross this northern part of the forest. There are two types of barrier to prevent public vehicles accessing the open heathland, and these can both be seen in this photo. In the foreground is a shallow ditch in the verge of the tarmac road, and the gravel track has wooden posts or "dragon's teeth" lining it. These were put in place in the early 1970s to restrict campers to the Forestry Commission sites and prevent damage to the heathland.;;neutral

I've never seen anything that came close to the 5 tonne limit crossing them (mostly walkers and cyclists) but it's possible that Forestry Commission vehicles make use of them.;;neutral
43060;;This part of the New Forest, to the NE of Brockenhurst, consists of many square kilometres of ancient woodland and more modern plantations. The many paths through the trees are liable to become very boggy after only a little rain, and a network of them have been improved and given a gravel surface to withstand the pressure from off-road cyclists (mostly holidaying families staying at the nearby large Forestry Commission campsites).;;neutral
43408;;The camp site is easy to get to, as it lies immediately to the east of the A337 between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst, but for those trying to 'get away from it all' the noise of the busy road must be quite distracting. It is also sited on wet grassland, adjacent to Balmer Lawn: very pretty, but the ground doesn't drain too well! The wooden posts in the foreground (dragons teeth) are found all over the Forest, and are intended to limit vehicular access. The Forestry Commission has recently outlined plans to reduce the size of this campsite, moving this northern boundary further south.;;neutral
43463;;A typical view of the contents of this grid square, which mostly consists of the coniferous Hawkhill Inclosure. In the clearings between the trees you usually find bracken growing, with the occasional silver birch (foreground on the left). The policy of the Forestry Commission, which manages the majority of the Forest's inclosures, is moving away from these coniferous trees and back to the more eco-diverse broadleaved trees.;;positive
43487;;Looking west from the verge of the B3054 road, towards the trees of Hilltop Wood. The Beaulieu Estate, although geographically within the New Forest, is not managed by the Forestry Commission. The public access granted to the open Forest and Inclosures does not apply to the woods like this on private land, except where there are public rights of way. The character of the private woodland is similar to that of the adjacent Forest, and the wild deer (who can jump the fences) probably live in peace without being disturbed by walkers' dogs.;;neutral
43995;;This is the site of a hutted camp occupied by a unit of the Portuguese army during the first world war.

There was a museum at Lewis Burn that had a display about Plashetts which was quite good but I'm not certain if the Visitor Centre at Tower Knowe has any materials on Plashetts. It's a great pity that the archaeological work by the Newcastle University students came to an end and that the Forestry Commission or Northumbrian Water Board have done nothing to maintain the site. Considering the amount of money that has been spent over the years in signage and architectural features it's bewildering that there isn't at least one interpretation board on the Plashetts site.

Lowland meadows are examples of one of our most threatened and beautiful habitats. 97% of them have disappeared nationally since 1945. Given these dramatic losses, it is all the more important to restore this rare habitat where possible. Old maps dating from 1820 show a long, thin meadow in the heart of Finemere Wood. After the First World War, like other woodland meadows, Long Close ceased to be grazed or cut and fell into neglect. Young trees and shrubs, known as scrub, gradually took over. In the 1960s, the Forestry Commission planted conifers. Some of these died and willow and blackthorn scrub replaced them. Since 1989, BBONT has owned and managed the site. Volunteers are now cutting down the scrub to recreate the lost wet meadow. The area will be grazed by cattle to prevent the scrub from returning, and allowing wildflowers to flourish. Already wet meadow plants such as ragged-Robin, meadowsweet and water mint are appearing, as well as grizzled skipper and marbled white butterflies which prefer woodland clearings. Banded demoiselle dragonflies can also be seen, benefiting from the sunny clearings and the slow moving stream. The water level of the meadon will be kept high in spring.

The graffiti artist signed as 'G. Wadham. Southall. 5/3/43'. Although the carving on the remotely located 400-year-old beech tree was already known to the Forestry Commission, National Trust and local historians this 'discovery' resulted in a brief flurry of interest in the national media as they tried to track down the mysterious G. Wadham in a bid to find out who the carving, dubbed by the newspaper red tops as The Naked Lady of the Woods, depicted. Locals believed the work was done by a British soldier on wartime exercise, or was perhaps that of a Canadian serviceman as there was a large Canadian army camp nearby. However a journalist from the Daily Mail eventually determined that there had been one Gerald Wadham who settled in the Hindhead area after the war when he ran a shop and a pub, and coincidentally was living in Southall in 1943. Sadly he died five years ago and his family were unaware of the carving, so the identity of the woman went with him to the grave, if indeed he was the creator. The Daily Mail's claim that the route of the tunnel road was diverted in order to save the tree was officially denied by our contact at the contractors. The tree and its mysterious woman is safe for future generations to ponder upon.;;neutral

1011057;;This is one of two ancient yew trees situated within the "Plaisance" (a walled garden beside Kelburn Castle). The trees are certified as over one thousand years old. Note, though, that dating yew trees is not a simple matter of counting rings: "after 400 or 500 years almost all yews begin to lose their heartwood and become hollow, making dating by ring-counts impossible. They also enter long periods of suspended growth, when they put on virtually no extra girth at all." [Richard Mabey, "Flora Britannica"] The Common Yew, Taxus baccata, is usually a dioecious species: there are separate male and female trees. One of the trees in the Plaisance is a male, while the other is a female. The nearby castle has been continuously inhabited by the same family (Boyle) since the first Norman keep was built on the site in about 1200, but their ancestors (then surnamed "de Boyville") arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror in 1066. However, if their age has been correctly determined, then these venerable trees pre-date even that arrival. Particularly ancient yew trees are often found in churchyards (the Fortingall Yew, located in a churchyard, is among Europe's oldest known trees: [[847537]]). It may be that, in pre-Christian tradition, their poisonous seeds made them symbols of death, while their longevity and their evergreen foliage made them, at the same time, fitting symbols of immortality. In 2002, the Kelburn Yews were included in the Forestry Commission's list of "100 Heritage Trees of Scotland".;;neutral

1091076;;Christmas Day 2008. The bench contains an inscription to Morgan Philips Price "who owned and loved these woods". The Malverns are visible in the distance. Morgan Philips Price was, like his father (who died when M P Price was only a year old) and grandfather, a politician (being MP for the Whitehaven district of Cumberland from 1929-1931 and later for the Forest of Dean) and was director of the timber firm Price Walker and Co. After graduating from Cambridge, where he studied science, he travelled extensively in central Asia, Siberia, Persia and Turkey on geological expeditions and on behalf of the family timber firm which obtained much of its raw material from Russia. (He later became the Manchester Guardian's special correspondent in Petrograd during World War I). He had a particular interest in the study of forestry which found a practical application in the management of the woodlands on his own estates and became an authority on the subject. He was at one time the Labour Party representative on the Forestry Commission and was chairman of the Gloucestershire branch of the Royal English Forestry Society during the 1960s. His interest is reflected in the files on woodland management listed as section D2176/2/5 below. M P Price preferred the house at the Grove, Taynton (which he himself had purchased) to Tibberton Court and so the family moved there during the 1930s. Henceforth, the Grove became the centre from which farming operations were directed although Peter Price lived for many years in a flat in Tibberton Court.;;neutral

1411390;;This area has had a varied history of land use. Up until the 1960s it was flood meadows for the River Alt, and in hard winters in the middle of the 20th century the ice was skated on by local inhabitants. In summer, birds such as Snipe and Redshank, now absent in the area, bred in the meadows. From the 1960s the area was used as a landfill site, with this particular area filled in the mid 1970s, covered in topsoil and left. An interesting natural ecosystem then began to develop, with scarce breeding birds for the area such as Sedge Warbler, Grasshopper Warbler and Meadow Pipit, while Short-eared Owls were present in winter. In the early 1980s, however, the land was reverted to agriculture, this apparently being a pre-condition of the initial permission to tip there. The whole area was ploughed and crops grown, but agriculture returned only briefly however, before the local farmer decided it wasn't worth tilling. The area began to revert to the rough grassland that was developing before it was ploughed, but a small copse of trees had been planted. Since then, there has been extensive planting and the area is now managed by the Forestry Commission and named Jubilee Wood.

1470892;;Warwickslade Cutting was a long, straight drainage ditch dug around 1850. In 2009, The Forestry Commission decided to fill it in and replace it by a more natural, meandering stream. The contractors were Alaska Environmental Contracting ( http://www.alaska.ltd.uk/ ). It was necessary to bring in 10,000 tonnes of hoggin to fill in the cutting. That would have been 1,000 round trips for the Morooka MST-2200vd tracked dumper truck ( http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1438683 ). Alaska decided as an experiment to design and build a light railway from this point, reached via a forest track, to the cutting. This photo shows the start of the railway track, the laying of which was a morning's work. It was being laid along a wide, grassy forest track. The track consists of circular steel pipe of about 6mm wall thickness, welded to steel cross members which are in turn bolted to wooden sleepers. As can be seen from the righthand track in the photo, one side is fitted with a steel spike to engage with the next section. Thus, it fits together very much like a toy railway, using preassembled track sections which are either straight or of fixed curvature. The purpose of the railway was to reduce the environmental impact of bringing so much material on site. The Morooka dumper truck has an engine of 250 HP whereas Alaska thought that they could shift the same 10 tonnes of gravel in a train powered by a Boxer 532DX mini-skid (the tracked vehicle seen on the righthand rails) which has a 32 HP engine.

This is necessary because the diagonal struts which resist the considerable force of the horizontal high-tensile steel wires, also exert an upwards force upon the strainer posts which might otherwise pop out of the ground. It was too wet to get a tractor in here, so the contractors had to use the old fashioned back-breaking method of bashing the posts in. Next http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1576019;;neutral

Erected in the location that was once the visitors' car park the work consisted of curved, sloping, banks something like a range of escarpments. The original shape is much obscured now by collapse, becoming overgrown, and settlement. As originally constructed it reminded me of a half scale Napoleonic era redoubt. At around the time this work was installed the forestry commission were fighting a running battle with a group of hippie musicians who were inclined to turn up unbidden for equinoxial festivals.

They sell or hire bikes, seem to carry a good stock of spare parts and even have a bike wash! Delamere Forest, an area of approximately 2,400 acres (972 hectares), is one of the last remnants of the Ancient Forests of Mara and Mondrem, a hunting forest that once spread for over 60 square miles in the North-West of Cheshire and was owned by the Norman Earls of Cheshire. The harsh Forest Laws of the time greatly limited the use of the ground for agriculture until the early 13th century when the laws were relaxed and parts of the southern forest of Mondrem began to be cleared. Ownership of the remains of the great forests passed to the Crown in 1812, with Delamere Forest being handed to the Forestry Commission soon after it was set up in 1919 and they still manage it to this day. It is very popular with walkers, cyclists and horse riders with several way-marked trails and tracks; there is also a Go-Ape aerial adventure course. Delamere Forest comprises a mix of habitats with Broad-leaved and Conifer woodlands at various stages of growth, with areas of grassland and wetland in between. These provide a home for many woodland birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, crossbills, siskins, tawny owls and greater spotted and green woodpeckers. Dragonflies such as the nationally scarce White Faced Darter and the Southern Hawker can be found in the wetland areas, along with Marsh Fern and White Sedge- both locally scarce plants.

The Grey Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) was introduced to Britain from North America in the mid 19th century by wealthy Victorian landowners looking for a 'novelty' species to release on their estates. Since then this intelligent, adaptable and hardy animal has spread across parks, gardens and woodlands driving out the native Red Squirrel from its habitats and feeding grounds and sending them to the brink of extinction, out-competing the Red in nearly all its life stages including resistance to disease. Recent research suggests that it will also compete for food with the already struggling native woodland birds, in 2000 the Forestry Commission estimated that Grey Squirrels can cause up to GBP 10 million pounds worth of damage in both the economic and amenity value of woodland areas thus making it a major threat to our native biodiversity. Indeed, this threat has become so great the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), www.iucn.org/ , have listed it as being one of the 100 worst invasive species globally.;;neutral

Just in case the link disappears in years to come, I feel that it will be useful to reproduce the following text, perfect in its conciseness while full of poignant information, from the Welsh Countryside Magazine website. "Capel Soar y Mynydd, a Welsh Calvinist Methodist chapel, was built by the River Camddwr in 1822 by Rev Ebenezer Richards of Tregaron and his trustees to serve the hill farmers of the remote upper valleys. It was also used as a school until the 1940s but the great and tragic snow storm of 1947 when the Tywi valley was cut off for three months and the sheep froze to death was the final blow to the last 7 families of sheep farmers in the valley who sold out in the end to the Forestry Commission. It is difficult for today's visitor to realise what a thriving community lived in these parts, for example, Dolgoch ( http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1839756 ) in 1944 was the largest farm boasting 2,500 acres, and could record in that year that over 100 people attended its shearing day when 85 shearers dispatched 2,000 sheep and over 700 lambs." http://www.welshcountry.co.uk/in-your-area/960-ceredigion/5803-soar-y-mynydd;;neutral

Forestry Wales has always been good at the work and some effort has produced a result therein, but there is drainage practice that needs review, this being a subsurface source with flood rains and melt flow addition as yet not researched unlike many Forestry standard procedures, Plynlimon, Scotland, the South West and Northumberland.;;negative

2769560;;Blakemere Moss was originally formed from two kettle holes (water filled hollows formed by a detached mass of glacial ice melted in situ towards the end of the last ice age). The area was drained from the 1800's, supposedly by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars and planted with trees, (mainly oak and Scot's Pine) between 1793-1815 to provide timber for shipbuilding. The Forestry Commission planted the moss with pine and western hemlock during the 1940s, which proved uneconomic. In the late 1990's the Commission allowed the area to re-flood again naturally. Blakemere Moss now provides a habitat for wildlife, particularly birds including Greylags, Canada Geese, Black-headed Gulls, Coots, Mallards and Lapwings. It has been rapidly recolonised by rare mosses such as the orange-brown Sphagnum pulchrum as well as wildlife like diving beetles and great crested newts.

The original building was originally located to the south of the current one which was built in 1930 to replace it. To protect its sources of water from contamination from pesticides and fertilisers the Eastbourne Water company began planting the surrounding Friston Forest in 1926 though this project was halted in 1939 as some of the land reverted to agricultural use or was used for military training. The planting resumed after the war and has resulted in a forest that covers an area of 795 hectares.

Hockering Wood is a 90-hectare SSSI, managed by J Cheetham Forestry under a plan agreed with and grant-aided by English Nature and the Forestry Commission. It is described as being one of the largest remaining ancient woodlands in Norfolk and particularly special because it is dominated by small-leaved lime trees, which are uncommon in East Anglia. The wood is occasionally closed to enable management operations to be undertaken safely but is currently open to the public. During WW2, Hockering Wood was used as a Forward Ammunition Depot under the command of No. 231 Maintenance Unit that was primarily designed to store and supply bombs to 2 Group Bomber Command in Norfolk. Constructed in the latter half of 1942, it was designed as a response to an increasing shortfall in the amount of bombs required to continue the air war over Axis controlled Europe. Several structures have survived, including a guard hut > > http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/4025588 beside the entrance (seen in background) which is in good condition. The wood is traversed by a network of old concrete tracks and as none of them is marked and there are no signposts it is fairly easy to lose one's sense of direction.

For a moment I thought I'd found a two-dimensional folly (lost here in the woods?) or something left over from location filming. I scrambled up the bank only to find that if there had ever been a track going over the bridge it was now completely overgrown. The other puzzle was the narrow path that went underneath, approaching in a long narrow trench. One possibility I considered was that there may have been a narrow-gauge railway here - like one I'd seen near Hascombe: http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3504260 Had I known more of the history of the area I'd have recognised this structure as one of the so-called Lovelace bridges - devised by William King, first Lord Lovelace, as part of a system for extracting timber. Ten bridges survive. The narrow passage beneath the bridge is in fact a bridleway - wagons loaded with logs went over the top. The system has been documented for Geograph by Colin Smith, who also describes a trail put together by the Horsley Countryside Preservation Society: http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/East-Horsleys-Lovelace-Bridges-Trail Plaques have been attached to a number of bridges, though not to this one (Briary Hill West) and I have to say that suits me, as I prefer to puzzle out the possibilities for myself!;;neutral

4674382;;The Duke of Argyll who owned most of Mull sold the lands around Tobermory in 1788 to the British Fisheries Society. The Estate was sold in 1821 to Hugh Maclean of Coll who built Aros House, then known as Druimfin House (access to the house was originally by way of Druimfin). The house was designed by William Burn in 1825 but was never completed as intended. In 1846 Aros passed to David Nairn of Drumkilbo. Alexander Crawford from Edinburgh acquired the Estate in 1850 and died a few years later so in 1856 the Estate was bought by Farquhar Campbell. The saw mill on the estate was built just before its sale in 1873. The Allan family owned and lived in Aros House from May 1874 to 1959. Bryce Allen who paid GBP 98,000 for the estate never lived here but bought the land with the profits from his Liverpool shipping firm. Alexander, his son, carried out alterations to the house and the family ran the house and park until 1959 when it became a financial burden. The Allan's sold the estate to the Forestry Commission who had no use for the house that was sold to a private buyer and stripped of its fine oak panelling and roof lead. Becoming a danger, the house was demolished by the Army in 1962. In 1969 the Forestry Commission opened the former grounds of Aros House to the public.;;neutral

4717086;;Blakemere Moss was drained in around 1815, supposedly by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars. During the 19th century, it was unsuccessfully planted with oak, and later with Scots pine. The Forestry Commission planted the moss with pine and western hemlock during the 1940s, which proved uneconomic. It was decided in 1992 to restore Blakemere Moss as a wetland environment, which was achieved in 1998 by clear-felling the area and then flooding it. The restored lake now provides a habitat for wildlife, particularly birds. Following the success of this project, it was announced in January 2010 that a further 33 hectares (82 acres) of drained fenland at four sites in the Delamere Forest area would be rewetted as part of Natural England's "Wetland Vision" scheme. *Source: Wikipedia;;neutral

The tubes also provide protection should there be a need for spray the undergrowth. They quickly became popular in the UK and are now used worldwide. Certainly sunlight is supposed to degrade modern Tuley Tubes after about eight years, sufficient time for the sapling to become established, but I see many examples where the trees have outgrown the tubes splitting them.

Bride Stones is a National Trust property of heather moorland lacerated by deep wooded valleys or griffs. Along the north east boundary is a prehistoric earthwork, a ditch and flanking banks, about a kilometre long and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Considerable time and effort went into the building of the dyke which is thought to be a way of demonstrating a Bronze Age tribe's territory. A status symbol. Over the years self sown trees and scrub from the adjacent Forestry Commission plantation have encroached over the earthworks which Historic England has said must be cleared to a distance of five metres either side. So that was the volunteering task for today, felling trees, cutting up into manageable lengths and stacking to provide wildlife habitats. With a kilometre of the earthworks to clear this is a long term task which has now finished for the winter in order to minimise disturbance for the coming bird nesting season.

It is amazing how rapidly usable trees are produced with some I recall being clear felled in the mid 1980s - in first cycle - replanted and being thinned again. Generally they are now much more aware of leaving a few older trees and seed sources all around mean natural regeneration is sometimes enough with very few saplings needing planting. There are also far more patches of deciduous but conifers are still very dominant.

It was decided in 1992 to restore Blakemere Moss as a wetland environment, which was achieved in 1998 by clear-felling the area and then flooding it. The restored lake now provides a habitat for wildlife, particularly birds. Following the success of this project, it was announced in January 2010 that a further 33 hectares (82 acres) of drained fenland at four sites in the Delamere Forest area would be rewetted as part of Natural England's "Wetland Vision" scheme. *Source: Wikipedia;;neutral

Natural ecology This ancient-beech hornbeam wood supports natural plant and animal communities that have developed over centuries, with rare creatures like the slender slug, many unusual fungi in the autumn, and silver-washed fritillary butterflies in summer. Notice how the ground layer of plants varies from one part of the wood to another with changes in soil and slope, with large patches of bluebells in some areas and primroses, wood sorrel and violets in others. Management Plan A management plan for the wood has been agreed with the Forestry Commission and felling consent granted to remove some of the planted larch. The aim is to return this ancient wood to broadleaved trees. Local conservation group Prestwood Nature monitors species in the wood annually and helps open glades to light by removing excessive holly, thinning young trees and coppicing. Check "www.prestwoodnature.org.uk" for more about the wood and its autumn fungus foray. The felling has given space for other trees to develop and allowed more light in which has benefited flowers, butterflies and bees. In recent years grey squirrels have damaged planted oaks and other young trees by stripping bark in the summer months; this causes the tops of the trees to die back and reduces the quality of the timber. Listen to the Talking Trail Audio Trail An audio trail can be downloaded from "www.anglingspringwood.org.uk" you can then play clips when you get to the various carved posts in the wood.

5874993;;This information board is located on the Chiltern Way between Carpenters Wood and Hillas Wood. It has the following wording: LEFT OF MAP Welcome to this special woodland. Carpenters Wood is an ancient semi-natural woodland site, meaning it has had woodland growing here for at least the last 400 years. It is made up of three areas - Hillas Wood, Whitelands Wood and the larger Carpenters Wood. The area is designated a County Wildlife Site and falls within the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and within the Metropolitan Green Belt. Public Access Carpenters Wood is owned and managed by Three Rivers District Council and the public are free to explore all areas by foot, although there is a clear path around the perimeter of the wood. On the eastern edge of the wood the public footpath follows a line at the base of the railway embankment. Access to horse riders and cyclists is restricted to the public bridleways, marked with blue arrows, and the permissive circular bridleway route marked in pink on this map. Wildlife The different compartments within this wood have different characters according to the make up of the soil and the woods management. Most of the more mature trees are beech and are around 150 years old. Also found naturally is oak, ash, cherry and hornbeam. Areas have been planted with a mixture of oak, cherry and hornbeam and most notably in Hillas Wood larch, a deciduous conifer, planted as a timber crop in the 1980s. This ancient wood is home to some special plants such as wood melick, coralroot bittercress and wood sanicle. Carpenters Wood is also carpeted with English bluebells in April and May. Interesting mammals include various species of bats, roe and muntjac deer. Standing dead wood provides nest sites for the lesser and greater spotted woodpeckers and a whole host of other organisms including fungi and insects. Other species such as butterflies, depend on light let in by felling trees or death of particularly large trees. Wide paths and woodland edges are sun traps for insects and flowers. RIGHT OF MAP History The Chilterns used to support a wide range of woodland industries including chair-making. Today, the woods are still harvested for timber but management for amenity, recreation and wildlife value has become equally important. An ancient hedge bank and ditch is still visible in places around the edge of the wood. This would have defined the boundary of the wood. Old pits are found on the eastern boundary which may have been the remains of sawpits, used by foresters to saw trees into planks to make them easier to remove. Besides this wording, the board also shows a map of the three woods plus illustrations from left to right, Coralroot Bittercress, Wood Melick and Bluebells. At the bottom right hand corner of the information board, it mentions that the area is supported by Forestry Commission England, Countryside Management Service and Three Rivers District Council.;;neutral

5929373;;- Coast Artillery Battery: EDoB ID: S0015240 No. 2 Gun Emplacement (Innes Links) The two gun emplacements here were a huge disappointment, having been heavily vandalised. Either in response to this or the structures are indeed in a dangerous condition as claimed, the Scottish Forestry Commission have surrounded both gun emplacements with protective fencing. The holdfast for the 6 in. gun in the centre has in recent times become a place to have a camp fire, with the accompanying rocks completing the ensemble. The painted walls of course just adds to the party atmosphere of the place (Lord forgive them for they know not what they do...). The emergency coastal gun battery is situated on the seaward side of an old fishing station, and consists of two 6 inch gun emplacements, three engine rooms, a Base Observation Post, two magazines, and two searchlight platforms. Original wartime camouflage paint is visible on several buildings still in remarkable condition. There are holdfasts extant in each emplacement.

5947547;;Blakemere Moss was drained in around 1815, supposedly by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars. During the 19th century, it was unsuccessfully planted with oak, and later with Scots pine. The Forestry Commission planted the moss with pine and western hemlock during the 1940s, which proved uneconomic. It was decided in 1992 to restore Blakemere Moss as a wetland environment, which was achieved in 1998 by clear-felling the area and then flooding it. The restored lake now provides a habitat for wildlife, particularly birds. Following the success of this project, it was announced in January 2010 that a further 33 hectares (82 acres) of drained fenland at four sites in the Delamere Forest area would be rewetted as part of Natural England's "Wetland Vision" scheme. *Source: Wikipedia;;neutral

5227010;;Ingrebourne Hill was completed in partnership between the Forestry Commission and Ingrebourne Valley Limited (IVL).The site was a former sand and gravel quarry, which was filled with a range of materials, including bricks, concrete and metal before IVL purchased the site.

3268739;;In the Early years of the 20th century this area of Bourne was still part of the shared field system of The Westfield, in particular the 'Stray Pastures' a large sort of Pinfold. Part of it was taken after the First World War, for a Ministry of Labour camp, ostensibly for the training of redundant ex-servicemen in agricultural practices. Up to the 1930s men, often apparently from the Sheffield area, were housed here and did extensive work draining and replanting Bourne Wood. They also worked for Bourne United Charities constructing the park at the Abbey Field. The camp later became the Hereward School, an approved school to which youth offenders would be sentenced. It must have looked quite a lot like an army Barracks, the 1920s OS map shows parallel rows of huts, and during the Second World War the Germans mistook it for such a barracks and bombed it ineffectually. After the school closed, most of the huts were sold but some were retained by the Forestry Commission, to house the dozen or so Forestry workers and their families. By the 1980s the Forestry Commission was working from Fineshade, and the houses were extensively renovated and sold. The 8 remaining huts became 3 bungalows, now known as Hereward Bungalows, now private homes of a most idiosyncratic kind. These little houses are unrecognisable as an odd bit of Bourne History.

6287410;;The celebrated totem poles of Stonehaugh were first fashioned by forestry workers in 1971 at a time when chainsaws were a novelty. After the base of the poles rotted, they were replaced in 1982 and again in 1992. In 2018, the poles were taken down for a third time; after removing the rotten parts, the truncated totem poles have been re-erected behind the village hall. Meanwhile work is under way to prepare a fourth set of poles. Forestry England have donated three 80ft larch tree trunks. Responsibility for the three new designs has been undertaken separately by Eggers, the timber board manufacturers in Hexham, by the Forestry England in discussion with Wark First School, and by the National Park.
